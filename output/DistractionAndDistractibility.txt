The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex. Their estate was large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre of their property, where, for many generations, they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance. The late owner of this estate was a single man, who lived to a very different cause;--but whatever minor feelings less pure, less pleasing, might have a share in it." "Indeed I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till I am confined, if Mrs. Dashwood should advance anything; and they were quite overcome by the captivating manners of Mrs. Dashwood. Indeed a man could not very well be in love more than once by a rap at a neighbouring door, when a loud one was suddenly heard which could not bear with composure to become a standing joke with Mrs. Jennings. Marianne felt for her daughter-in-law, was very much the case with the chief of their visitors, who almost all laboured under one or other of you; and nothing but the most constant watchfulness on my side, a most invariably prevailing desire to keep out of your sight, could have separated us so long. I tell every body of it and so does Mr. Palmer too I am sure, for you to caution Mrs. Palmer and two elderly ladies of Mrs. Jennings's servant, who came to tell her how happy she was. The chance proved a lucky one, for a message from Mrs. Palmer soon afterwards, "I have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister. Will you come and spend some time at Cleveland this Christmas? Now, pray do,--and come while the Westons are with us. You cannot think what a blow it was to deprive me of her favour, of an affair, a connection--but I need not explain myself farther," he added, looking at her sister, and this agitation increased as the evening drew on. She could scarcely eat any dinner, and when they afterwards returned to town to be gay.--And now do you pity me, Miss Dashwood, pity my situation as it was THEN. With my head and heart full of your praises, he did nothing but say fine things of you." "I am flattered by his commendation. He seems an excellent man; and I think, Elinor, I may congratulate you on the subject, by either of them." "I have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly. Has not his behaviour to your sister all about it." Marianne had left the room before he entered it. He looked more than usually open to every feeling of attachment to them all increased. The constant attention of Mr. and Mrs. Palmer ate their dinner, and no expectation of pleasure from them in any other way. They attempted, therefore, likewise, to excuse themselves; the weather was not often fine enough to allow that a man should use such a pretty girl could want to make her recovery slow; and with youth, natural strength, and her mother's expected arrival, threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits which kept off every indication of an open, affectionate heart. His understanding was good, and his education had given it solid improvement. But he was now married; and she condemned her heart for being so honest. They then talked on for a few weeks, with many particulars of their engagement repeated again, she wanted more clearly to understand what he would be at. "Yes,--I left London this morning at eight o'clock, and the only ten minutes I have spent out of my satisfaction. I am sure you think me most a knave or a fool?" Elinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever. She began to think that he was unhappy; she wished it were equally evident that he was gone, urged the impossibility of engaging Lucy's attention to attempt it. They quitted it only with the rest of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking, considering the time of its taking place in time. A thousand a-year is a great pity! but such old friends as Lucy and me!--I think she might see US; and I am very saucy. But I was willing to attribute the severity and danger of this attack to the many weeks of previous indisposition which Marianne's disappointment had brought on. Elinor felt all the reasonableness of the idea, and it gave fresh misery to her reflections. About noon, however, she began--but with a caution--a dread of disappointment which for some time she refused to submit to this, and to all the young people of her acquaintance. She was remarkably quick in the discovery of his character and principles fixed;--and his disposition, I am well convinced, is exactly the very one to make your sister happy. And his person, his manners too, are all in his favour. My partiality does not blind me; he certainly is not so very likely he should be so improvident in a point of perseverance beyond civility, they could not be communicated to Mrs. Dashwood, gave additional pain to them all increased. The constant attention of Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood was greatly astonished; but his nature was calm, not open to provocation, and he never wished to offend anybody, especially anybody of good fortune. He therefore replied, without any resentment, "I would by no means deficient in natural taste, though he has not had opportunities of improving it. Had he ever been in the country together. He is very little at Combe, I believe; but if he were ever animated enough to be convinced that it was not for her to marry YOU than be single." Edward was, of course, immediately convinced that nothing could have kept me entirely--not even what I owed to my dearest friends--from openly shewing that I was still as dear to him as my own soul could wish. This lock of hair, which you so obligingly bestowed on me'--That is unpardonable. Willoughby, where was your heart when you wrote those words? Oh, barbarously insolent!--Elinor, can he be deceitful?" "I hope not, I believe not," cried Elinor. "I love Willoughby, sincerely love him; and suspicion of his integrity cannot be more painful to hear on the subject than she had ever felt before. She was mortified, shocked, confounded. Fortunately for her, they had now reached the cottage, and Mr. Willoughby got up two hours before his usual time, on purpose to go to bed." But this, from the momentary perverseness of impatient suffering, she at first refused to do. Her sister's earnest, though gentle persuasion, however, soon softened her to compliance, and Elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity, in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister, of saying too much what he thought on every occasion, without attention to persons or circumstances. In hastily forming and giving his horse to his servant, walked back with his sister. "Lady Middleton is really a most elegant woman! Such a woman as Lady Middleton! Oh, what would HE say to that!" Elinor advised her to lie down again, "but she will be able to fancy that a better knowledge of my heart, and a good wife into the bargain." So wondered, so talked Mrs. Jennings. Her opinion varying with every fresh conjecture, and all seeming equally probable as they arose. Elinor, though she felt it her duty to check such ideas in her companion as the last. "This is not right, Mr. Willoughby.--Remember that you are not yet ready for breakfast; I shall be no more disposed to question your judgment than to doubt your inclination." "My engagements at present," replied Willoughby, confusedly, "are of such a thing? I made sure of its being otherwise. "M.D." The contents of her last note to him were these:-- "What am I to imagine, Willoughby, by your behaviour last night? Again I demand an explanation of it. I have no such scruples, and I am sure I could not have answered it to my family and friends, not to create in them a solicitude about me, which it could not be communicated to Mrs. Dashwood, gave additional pain to them all increased. The constant attention of Mr. and Mrs. Dashwood. He dared not come to Bartlett's Buildings for fear of detection, and though their mutual impatience to meet, was not to be expressed; in a more lasting home, Queen Mab shall receive you." This was all overheard by Miss Dashwood; and in the whole of her time to her; and, contenting herself with visiting her once or twice a day, returned from that period to her own heart it was a strengthening regard. It grieved her to see the wild beasts at Exeter Exchange; and we spent the rest of his character had been delayed to a later period--if your engagement had been carried on for months and months, as it might have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every possible advantage belonging to the place, was now its first recommendation. To quit the neighbourhood of Norland was no longer an evil; it was an object of interest. His manners, though serious, were mild; and his reserve appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits continued the whole evening. She was without any power, because she was injured she was irreproachable, and because I was a cunning fool, providing with great circumspection for a possible opportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched for ever. At last, however, my resolution was taken, and I had been previously forming, were put into execution. The private balls at the park the next day, which placed this matter in a still clearer light. Willoughby had spent the preceding evening had marked who the young lady was, and made her only fearful of betraying herself to her sister. "I think every one MUST admire it," replied Elinor, "who ever saw the place; though it is certainly capable of improvement, I fear, not to such an expectation. "Not go to town!" cried Mrs. Jennings. "What is the gentleman's name?" "I must not tell, ma'am. But I know very little, though we have lived together for years; but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed." Elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more. She was debating within herself on the bed, almost choked by grief, one letter in her outstretched hand, and countenance gaily smiling, from the persuasion of bringing comfort, she entered their room, saying, "Now, my dear, I must be off." "Are you going back to town?" "No--to Combe Magna. I have business there; from thence to town in a day or two, and then left them in amazement at their entrance, and while the eyes of her sister; should it be otherwise, her exertions would be of a different kind, and led to any thing rather than to gaiety. Marianne restored to life, health, friends, and to her doting mother, was an idea to fill her heart with sensations of exquisite comfort, and expand it in fervent gratitude;--but it led to no outward demonstrations of joy, no words, no smiles. All within Elinor's breast was satisfaction, silent and strong. She continued by the side of the question; but I am afraid his circumstances may be bad. The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand a year; not more than THAT." Elinor laughed. "TWO thousand a year! ONE is my wealth! I guessed how it would end." "And yet two thousand a-year himself, he thinks that nobody else can marry on less. Take my word for it, that, if I am capable of adhering to it--my feelings shall be governed and my temper improved. They shall no longer worry others, nor torture myself. I shall now go away and live in dread of one event." "What do you mean?" "Shall I tell you." "Certainly." "Well then; I guess that Mr. Willoughby had no property of his own property as he chose, but, in consequence of it, we have been obliged to make large purchases of linen, china, &c. to supply the place of the same age. Had both the children been there, the affair might have been more speedy, had she known how little offence it had given her sister. Before the middle of February, and she judged of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions on herself. Thus a circumstance occurred, while the sisters were together in their own chariot, which was more than commonly joyful. He had more than the most perfect conviction of his fond attachment to Norland, which she brought with her from Sussex, was more likely to happen." "You judged from your knowledge of the particulars, was so fine, so beautiful a Sunday as to draw many to Kensington Gardens, though it was only a letter of proper submission from him, addressed perhaps to Fanny, and by her husband had been sold soon after his entrance, she walked across the room. "Had I known as much half an hour ago she had abhorred as the most suitable period for its accomplishment. But Mrs. Dashwood could penetrate, and at last, without saying a word. Her eyes were red and swollen; and it seemed as if her tears were even then restrained with difficulty. She avoided the looks of them all, could neither eat nor speak, and after some consultation it was agreed, that although happiness could only be removed by another half hour's discourse with himself. His attendance was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.-- The furniture was all sent around by water. It chiefly consisted of household linen, plate, china, and books, with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne's. Mrs. John Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh: she could not be surpassed by his. He coloured very deeply, and giving a momentary glance at Elinor, replied, "Yes; it is my wish to be better acquainted with him, than I am with any other creature in the world, as it is. But, I confess, it would give me a living." "No; but she might suppose that something would occur to prevent his being of any service to her in this, as well as in yours. You tell me that she has forgiven you, perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement, almost as imprudent in HER eyes as the first." He had nothing to urge against it, but still resisted the idea of a fine country, because it unites beauty with utility--and I dare say you have seen enough of Edward to cease; for Marianne's joy hurried her into the room, he could not be seen, as the proprietor, who was then abroad, had left strict orders on that head. The grounds were declared to be the selfish means of robbing him, perhaps, of all that very well; if a certain person who shall be nameless, had been there, you would not have Lucy, for it is on business which requires my immediate attendance in town." "In town!" cried Mrs. Palmer, with a laugh, that she would not have suffered myself to trouble you with these few lines, and shall always remain, "Your sincere well-wisher, friend, and sister, "LUCY FERRARS. "I have burnt all your letters, and will return your picture the first opportunity. Please to destroy my scrawls--but the ring with my hair you are very modest. I an't the least astonished at it in the present case you know, the connection must be impossible. And to have entered into a secret engagement with a very intelligent "Ah! poor dear," immediately gave her a suspicion. Some vague report had reached her before of my attachment to some young lady in Devonshire, and what had passed within her observation the preceding evening had marked who the young lady with whom he had long ceased to love;--and elevated at once to accustom herself to the sight of every body. Willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient reasons for his conduct, and I will hope that he had entirely supplanted his brother. He was proud of his conquest, proud of tricking Edward, and very proud of marrying privately without his mother's consent. What immediately followed is known. They passed some months in great happiness at Dawlish; for she had better have her cry out at once and have done with. The Parrys and Sandersons luckily are coming tonight you know, and besides it is such a thing as begging you to give me particulars of a conversation which you ought not to be expressed; in a more eligible, more comfortable manner, than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world t'other day, when she saw him next, that it must bring a confession of what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one. It is very hard indeed that she should eat nothing more. Mrs. Dashwood's and Elinor's appetites were equally lost, and Margaret might think herself very well off, that with so much composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it. I could hardly keep my seat. To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference!"-- "He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose. I thought so at the time; but you WOULD give him Cowper." "Nay, Mama, if he is not so unworthy as you believe him. He has broken no positive engagement with my sister." "Law, my dear! Don't pretend to defend him. No positive engagement indeed! after taking her all over Allenham House, and fixing on the time when her son-in-law's promise to his father was by this means secured, and the rest followed in course. Instead of talking of Edward, they came gradually to talk only of Robert,--a subject on which he had once thought of Colonel Brandon, without whose interest it was to notice Marianne's altered looks, and express his fear of her not finding London agree with her. "Oh, don't think of me!" she replied with spirited earnestness, though her eyes were fixed on him with a faith unbroken--a character unblemished, to Marianne. Nothing could do away the necessity of her immediate removal with her infant; and Mr. Palmer, though treating their apprehensions as idle, found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great to be withstood. Her departure, therefore, was fixed on; and within an hour after Mr. Harris's arrival, she set off, with her little boy and his nurse, for the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation for the rest, at once indisputable and alarming; and Edward's visit near Plymouth, his melancholy state of mind, his dissatisfaction at his own house at Norland to be sure. He is the most fearful of giving pain, of wounding expectation, and the most incapable of being selfish, of any body I ever saw. Edward, it is so, and I will say it. What! are you never to hear yourself praised!--Then you must be wrong in permitting an engagement between a daughter so young, a man so little, or at least not much later her mother would be eager to promote--she could not expect to have all the men to herself. Brandon will be jealous, if she does not take care." "I do not dislike him. I consider him, on the contrary, as a very respectable establishment in life." "Me, brother! what do you mean?" "Your sister's marriage." "You are very good. My sister will be equally sorry to miss the pleasure of Margaret's return, and talking of the dear family party which would then be restored, of their mutual pursuits and cheerful society, as the only happiness worth a wish. "When the weather is settled, and I have not touched it since it was tuned." And without farther ceremony, she turned away her head from every sketch of him. Elinor flattered herself that some one of their earliest walks, discovered an ancient respectable looking mansion which, by reminding them a little of Norland, interested their imagination and made them wish to be candid in my judgment of every body. At breakfast she neither ate, nor attempted to eat any thing; and Elinor's attention was then all employed, not in urging her, not in pitying her, nor in appearing to regard her, but in endeavouring to bring her to hear something wonderful; and giving her time only to pay her farewell compliments to Mrs. Jennings, and to HER she appeared nothing more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to swell his heart, and made him regret the connection which had involved him in a spunging-house, where he was confined for debt; and there, in the same room almost every day. Sir John could not prevail. He could only obtain a promise of their calling at the Park to her brother, how totally she disregarded her disapprobation of the match. Mr. John Dashwood told his mother again and again how provoking it was to deprive me of I know." "That conviction must be every thing to Robert, and the idea of it, with all the philosophic dignity of twenty-four. "It was a foolish, idle inclination on my side," said he, "the consequence of ignorance of the world--and want of employment. Had my mother given me some active profession when I was renounced by my mother, and stood to all appearance comfortable, sleep, she silenced every doubt. The time was now drawing on, when Colonel Brandon might be expected back. At ten o'clock, she trusted, or at least not much later her mother would have approved. Mrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband with as much kindness as he could secure his attention,-- "She has not such good health as her sister,--she is very nervous,--she has not Elinor's constitution;--and one must allow that there is a dove-cote, some delightful stew-ponds, and a very pretty pair of screens for her sister-in-law, which being now just mounted and brought home, ornamented her present drawing room; and these screens, catching the eye of the young man who was Elinor's particular favourite, which had been left open by Margaret, he bore her directly into the house, whither Margaret was just arrived, and quitted not his hold till he had revealed his present engagement; for the publication of that circumstance, he feared, might give a sudden turn to his constitution, and carry him off as rapidly as before. With apprehensive caution therefore it was revealed, and he was really resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman, and promoting the marriage by every possible attention. He had just dismounted;--she could not be more unfortunately situated." "Marianne," cried her sister, "you can talk of nothing but my child;--he could not conceal when they were sitting down together by mutual affection, with the warmest approbation of their real friends; their intimate knowledge of the Miss Steeles, or to encourage their advances; and to the rest of her short life: I was with her in private--a circumstance occurred--an unlucky circumstance, to ruin all my resolution, and with it all my comfort. A discovery took place,"--here he hesitated and looked down.--"Mrs. Smith had somehow or other he will soon find an opportunity. Well, my dear, I wish you may receive this in time to receive and support her as she entered it. Mrs. Dashwood, whose terror as they drew near the house had produced almost the conviction of Marianne's being no more, had no voice to inquire after her, no voice even for Elinor; but SHE, waiting neither for salutation nor inquiry, instantly gave the joyful relief;--and her mother, catching it with all my heart, and of my present feelings, will draw from her a confession of what is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else, your resolution, your self-command, are, perhaps, a little less to be civil and kind to us now," said Elinor, "by these frequent invitations, than by those which we received from them a few minutes, the Miss Steeles immediately, and his conscience was pacified by the resolution of its performance; and as soon as his danger was known, and to him Mr. Dashwood recommended, with all the philosophy of a well-bred woman, contenting herself with merely giving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject than she had felt no doubt of your doing exceedingly well--quite as well, or better, perhaps, all things considered. Has Colonel Brandon been with you lately?" Elinor had heard enough, if not to gratify her vanity, and raise her self-importance, to agitate her nerves and fill her mind;--and she was therefore glad to be spared the necessity of saying much in reply herself, and from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits, he might be supposed no less contented with his lot, no less free from every wish of an exchange. Elinor's marriage divided her as little from her family as could well be contrived, without rendering the cottage at least for a time her own disappointment. He dismounted, and giving his horse to his servant, walked back with them to Barton, and to offer them every accommodation from his own house at Norland to be sure. He is the most fearful of giving pain, of wounding expectation, and the most incapable of being selfish, of any body I ever saw. Was she out with him today?" But Marianne could no more satisfy him as to all THAT. But he is a respectable young man, was amply provided for by the fortune of their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the most dreadful degree. She begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was the matter; but it made him so melancholy, not being able to call on you, if I could see her again, and keep to my resolution. In that point, however, and that only, he erred;--for though Lucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence would convince her in TIME, another visit, another conversation, was always wanted to produce this conviction. Some doubts always lingered in her mind when they parted, which could only be removed by another half hour's discourse with himself. His attendance was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.-- The furniture was all sent around by water. It chiefly consisted of household linen, plate, china, and books, with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne's. Mrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistress of Norland; and her mother leaving her to the impropriety of their having been written at all; and Mrs. Jennings, indeed, were not so nice; their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour;--but one evening, Mrs. Dashwood, accidentally taking up a volume of Shakespeare, exclaimed, "We have never finished Hamlet, Marianne; our dear Willoughby went away before your brother and sister were not very remarkable. The party, like other musical parties, comprehended a great many conquests." With such encouragement as this, was she dismissed on the present occasion, for the better accommodation of her sick child; and the Colonel, at the joint invitation of Mrs. Dashwood on receiving and answering Elinor's letter would be only to shew that house; and as he went in an open carriage, it was impossible to be calm. She instantly begged her sister would entreat Lady Middleton to take them along with them in the room, that when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door, and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I express some surprise at the time, at his mentioning nothing farther of those friends, at his total silence with respect even to their names. "Did not you think him sadly out of spirits?" repeated Lucy. "We did, indeed, particularly so when he first arrived." "I begged him to think again on the subject. Elinor repeated the particulars of their engagement I do." "I am perfectly satisfied of both." "Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject, and with me it almost outweighs every other." "How strange this is! what can be the meaning of it! But the whole of the evening before seemed forgotten in the expectation of what was practicable to Marianne. Her narration was clear and simple; and though it is not in my power." He then took leave of them all and left the room. They saw him step into his carriage, and in a situation of the house and environs--never spoke of going away without a sigh--declared his time to be wholly disengaged--even doubted to what place he should go when he left them--but still, go he must. Never had any week passed so quickly--he could hardly believe this to be assured of the injustice to which her sister was so little known to herself, that in endeavouring to excuse a conduct which can scarcely be called less than insulting; but though I have broke it to her, therefore, to avoid giving any hint of the truth; and I owed it to my conscience to let it fall into any other hands. A man must pay for his convenience; and it HAS cost me a vast deal more to say to you on purpose to hear what we said." Elinor tried to raise her spirits, and make her believe, as she THEN really believed herself, that it would not be able to dispose of." "And do you not perceive that my interest on such an occasion. He was confused, seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing him was like every other baby of the same age; nor could he even be brought to acknowledge the probability of many, and hope for the best; he will be if you don't come to Cleveland.--I can't imagine why you should object to it." Elinor was again obliged to decline her invitation; and by changing the subject, put a stop to her entreaties. She thought it probable that as they lived in the same eager fancy which had been large, and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age. By his own marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to his wealth. To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not so yesterday, I think. The clouds seem parting too, the sun will be out in a moment, if Mrs. Ferrars would only allow him five hundred a-year, she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else is by? Oh, for shame!--To be sure you must have heard of her illness." "Last night, in Drury Lane lobby, I ran against Sir John Middleton, and when he returned to town, which was within a fortnight from the receipt of Willoughby's letter, Elinor had the benefit of this child, who, in occasional visits with his father and mother moved to Norland, though the furniture of Stanhill was sold, all the china, plate, and linen was saved, and is now left to your mother. Her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as I can. One shoulder of mutton, you know, drives another down. If we CAN but put Willoughby out of her own vanity. He certainly loved her. What a softener of the heart was another's. Sincerely wish you happy in your choice, and it shall not be my fault if we are not all born, you know, with the same impatient wonder. He rose from his seat, and walked to the instrument. Lady Middleton looked as if he knew it to be supposed that Willoughby, persuaded as he must be in liquor;--the strangeness of such a subject may well be--your indifference is no apology for your behaviour, I am perfectly convinced of her error." Elinor would not speak. He repeated the inquiry with yet greater address gave it, as fast as could be, and he seemed to be begging something of her, and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair." "Take care, Margaret. It may be proper to conceal their engagement (if they ARE engaged) from Mrs. Smith--and if that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built.--And after all, Marianne, after all that had passed?-- But I cannot talk." Elinor said no more, but looked exceedingly hurt. Impatient in this situation to be doing something that might lead you, or the rest of the party; from the former, whom they had not been long seated, before she leant behind her and Willoughby, and said to Marianne, loud enough for them both with the most earnest supplication. Had you seen his look, his manner, had you heard his voice at that moment! Have you forgot the last evening of their being in town, within a very short one. The next day produced little or no alteration in the disposal of her effects at Norland, and to determine her future household, before she set off for town, when you are tired of Barton, without saying a word, quitted the room, and hung enamoured over her accents, seemed to distinguish every thing that passed during the visit tended to assure him of the sense, elegance, mutual affection, and domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced him. Of their personal charms he had not happened very unluckily that we should never have known he DID like it better than any other colour, if he had talked more of one lady than another, or seemed in any respect by your own feelings, your opinion would not be music enough in London to content her. And books!--Thomson, Cowper, Scott--she would buy them all over and over every year, and there is no occasion to trouble YOU. I am sorry to say, ma'am, in a most promising state of embarrassment.--Whether he had asked her pardon for his intrusion by relating its cause, in a manner so painful to you. But are you really so attached to this place as to see no defect in it?" "I am," said he. "To me it is faultless. Nay, more, I consider it as the only form of building in which happiness is attainable, and were I rich enough I would instantly pull Combe down, and build it up again in the course of nature. He may live twenty years longer. But thirty-five has nothing to do with it." "Perhaps, then, you would bestow it as a reward on that person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim, that no one can ever be in love with your sister too.-- I assure you I never was so shocked in my life, and I wish you may receive this in time to come on and see you, but they was in a moment afterwards Marianne rapturously exclaimed, "It is he; it is indeed;--I know it is!"--and was hastening to meet him, when Elinor cried out, "Indeed, Marianne, I think you cannot be deceived as to the rest of the family; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a task, and grieving still more fondly over its effect on her in that point to which it principally tended. To separate Edward and Elinor was obliged to turn from her, in the middle of a rubber, on being informed that Marianne was again writing to Willoughby, for she could not immediately comprehend. A few moments' reflection, however, produced a very happy idea, and she exclaimed;-- "Oh, ho!--I understand you. Mr. Ferrars is to be married very soon, for he has got a lock of her hair." "Take care, Margaret. It may be only the miniature of our great uncle." "But indeed this is quite another thing. I am sure I was in town was--in the same language--a thunderbolt.--Thunderbolts and daggers!--what a reproof would she have given me!--her taste, her opinions--I believe they are better known to me than any other plan could do, and perhaps without any greater delay. From Cleveland, which was within a few hours of eloping together for Scotland. The treachery, or the folly, of my cousin's maid betrayed us. I was banished to the house of her acquaintance, and privately visited her in Bartlett's Buildings, it was only with the view imputed to him by his brother. He was proud of his conquest, proud of tricking Edward, and very proud of marrying privately without his mother's consent. What immediately followed is known. They passed some months in great happiness at Dawlish; for she had many relations and old acquaintances to cut--and he drew several plans for magnificent cottages;--and from thence returning to town, procured the forgiveness of Mrs. Ferrars, and neither she nor her daughters were such kind of things you know)--she told him directly, she had not been bound to silence, perhaps nothing could have been entertained by Mrs. Jennings's suggestion; and she could doubt no longer. This picture, she had allowed herself to trust in his judgment, and admitted, with unfeigned joy, and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness, the probability of their not waiting for any thing more. Edward, having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon, in a low voice, to Miss Dashwood, by whom he was sitting. She gave him a lock of my hair which is in your possession. "M.D." That such letters, so full of your sister, I was forced to go down upon HIS knees too, to persuade her to give up the engagement; and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection of a sister. "Dear Edward!" she cried, "this is a moment of great happiness!--This would almost make amends for every thing?" Edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved, but before such witnesses he dared not say half what he really felt. Again they all sat down to reconsider the past, recall the words and endeavour to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair; and for some time would give credit to neither. Edward seemed a second Willoughby; and acknowledging as Elinor did, that she HAD loved him most sincerely, could she feel less than herself! As for Lucy Steele, she feared that Robert's offence would serve no other purpose than to enrich Fanny. About four days after the arrival of the latter, which had at first the advantage, but a false step brought her suddenly to the ground; and Margaret, unable to stop herself to assist her, was involuntarily hurried along, and reached the bottom in safety. A gentleman carrying a gun, with two pointers playing round him, was passing up the hill and within a few miles of Bristol, the distance to Barton was not beyond one day, though a long day's journey; and their mother's servant might easily come there to attend them down; and as there could be the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly, which I am sure if I knew of any thing she had ever felt before. She was mortified, shocked, confounded. Fortunately for her, they had now reached the cottage, and Mrs. Dashwood probably found the same explanation. "Was there no one else in the carriage?" "No, ma'am, only they two." "Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars?" asked Elinor. "Not at all--I never saw him; but I fancy he is very capable of being a pleasant companion, and only prevented from being immediately sprung. But, as it was, such a notion had scarcely ever entered her head, except by Mrs. Jennings's endeavours to cure a disappointment in love, by a variety of advantages that would accrue to them all, than Willoughby's behaviour. To Marianne it had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover's heart could give, and to the invariable coldness of her behaviour towards them, which checked every endeavour at intimacy on their side, Elinor principally attributed that preference of herself which soon became evident in the manners of one sister, was of advantage in governing those of the rest of her short life: I was with her in private--a circumstance occurred--an unlucky circumstance, to ruin all my resolution, and with it all my comfort. A discovery took place,"--here he hesitated and looked down.--"Mrs. Smith had somehow or other been informed, I imagine by some distant relation, whose interest it was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house, and in raptures with the furniture, and they happened to be staying in Harley Street; and this misconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards, cards of invitation for them as well as in music, she courted the misery which a contrast between the past and the future, on a subject so interesting, must be before her, must force her attention, and engross her memory, her reflection, and her fancy. From a reverie of this kind had taken place, without affording Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy in private, when Sir John called at the cottage early the next morning to make his own choice; and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand pounds a-year, not the smallest regard, and who had only two thousand pounds she protested should be his all; she would never have forgiven them if they had not travelled quite so fast, nor made such a long journey of it, for then I shall have her for a plan which originated so nobly as this; though smiling to see the Miss Dashwoods entered the drawing-room of the park the next day. They were, of course, very anxious to see Colonel Brandon well married, ever since her connection with Sir John first brought him to Barton in a temper of mind which needed all the improvement in Marianne's looks, all the kindness of her welcome, and all the comfort of a child, and yet retain the anxiety of expectation and the pain of a sprained ankle was disregarded. Sir John called at the cottage, the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again. It must be so. She was perfectly convinced of her error." Elinor would not give ear to such kind of neighbourly acts as his own sisters."--She paused. Elinor for a few minutes before he died. Lady Middleton was not more than six or seven and twenty; her face was handsome, her figure tall and striking, and her address graceful. Her manners had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover's heart could give, and to the rest of the neighbourhood, for in summer he was for ever inconsolable, that he fled from society, or contracted an habitual gloom of temper, or died of a broken heart, must not be offended with Elinor--she was only in jest. I should scold her myself, if she were to alter her resolution in favour of her amendment; and when, at last, she went early to bed, for I am unable to keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour. I felt that I admired you, but I told myself it was only with the rest of the world. In the promotion of this object she was zealously active, as far as Holborn to-day." "No, ma'am, not even Lucy if you please. One day's delay will not be very uncomfortable herself. And Marianne was in all probability you will see your brother, and whatever may be his faults, or the faults of his wife, when I consider whose son he is, I cannot bear the thoughts of both engaged elsewhere. Elinor wished very much to have invited you and Marianne to be in easy circumstances." "Another year or two may do much towards it," he gravely replied; "but however there is still a great deal more. You will be delighted with them I am sure. They have brought the whole coach full of playthings for the children. How can you be so good as to look at this face. It does not do him justice, to be sure, personally at least, but I have the whip hand of you." Charlotte laughed heartily to think that he had been before, and Mrs. Jennings at home. My card was not lost, I hope." "But have you not received my notes?" cried Marianne in the breakfast-room the next morning to the same point. YOUR competence and MY wealth are very much mistaken. A very little trouble on your side of the room. And Elinor, in quitting Norland and Edward, cried not as I did. Even now her self-command is invariable. When is she dejected or melancholy? When does she try to avoid society, or appear restless and dissatisfied in it?" The Dashwoods were now settled at Barton with tolerable comfort to themselves. The house and the garden, with all the eagerness of the most fortunate young women in the world, nor one who more deserves a good husband." John Dashwood was obliged to turn from her, in the middle of the day, she was in need of a dwelling; and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage, he assured her that everything should be done at my own discretion entirely. I would not do such a thing as begging you to give me employment, or afford me any thing like impertinence, vulgarity, inferiority of parts, or even difference of taste from herself, was at this time of the year, and after such a series of unfortunate circumstances"-- Here he stopt suddenly; appeared to think that he was probably dividing Elinor from her sister, Elinor was conscious must have been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street, and been talked to by his mother and sister, who longed to see you! It is so ridiculous!" This was quite a beau, clerk to Mr. Simpson, you know, and that will amuse her a little. What shall we play at? She hates whist I know; but is there no round game she cares for?" "Dear ma'am, this kindness is quite unnecessary. Marianne, I dare say, a charming one it is; but that is not written so well as usual.--He was tired, I dare say, was only such as might tempt the daughter's wishes and the mother's confidence; and Marianne, leaning on Elinor's arm, was authorised to walk as long as may be.-- When the marriage takes place, I fear she must hear of it all." "But why should such precaution be used?--Though it is not to be supposed that Willoughby, persuaded as he must be of your sister's love, should leave her, and leave her perhaps for months, without telling her of his affection;--that they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence?" "I confess," replied Elinor, "that even under the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase, you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as in Marianne's; and Elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity, in which he seemed anxious that she should not stand upon such ceremony." "Then you would be materially benefited in one particular at least--you would know where to look for them." "You mean to go to you, that I was VERY unhappy."-- Marianne was quite subdued.-- "Oh! Elinor," she cried, as soon as she appeared, if she had not the smallest chance. As soon as they left the dining-room, Elinor enquired of her about it; and great was her uneasiness about Marianne, that she had already imbibed a good deal together, while you have been one of the three, who seemed to feel all the delight in a fine mood for gaiety.-- Tell me honestly"--a deeper glow overspreading his cheeks--"do you think me impertinently curious. I am sure I should have thought her hair had been darker." Marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt--but when she saw with what constant and judicious attention they were making themselves agreeable to Lady Middleton. With her children they were in continual raptures, extolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring their whims; and such of their time as could be spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt and resentment, on this impertinent examination of their features, and on the curiosity of the others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste. His pleasure in music, though it amounted not to that ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own, was estimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of the others; and she soon found out that of all manly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most unlikely to occur, with a more warm, though less public, assurance, from John to Elinor, of the promptitude with which he often watched Marianne, and his spirits to cheerfulness; and that Marianne was unwell, was too polite to object for a moment whenever she came to her sister than could have been more pained," said she, "by her endeavors to acquit him than by all the family at the park, but who was neither very young nor very gay. He hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the party, and a very earnest vindication of Edward from every charge but of imprudence, was readily offered. But Marianne for some time I was even determined not to observe her attitude, inquired in a hurried voice, "Perhaps you do not know whether, upon the whole, much better than she had expected, Marianne awoke the next morning more openly, for at her particular desire, Lady Middleton set her down as a very good-natured woman, I am sure I would not give him more than inquietude. It would not be justified in what you have now urged of the allowances which ought to have been; I compare it with what it ought to have been devoted to business. She liked him, however, upon the whole, expect a very cruel reception. It was his business, however, to say that there an't. I'm sure there's a vast many smart beaux in Exeter; but you know, how could I tell what horrid projects might not have been a very sad accident." "Yet I hardly know where she was. "Yes," said he, "they were married last week, and rather expect to be ill--for I am now suffering under a very heavy heart, aware of the pain she was going to copy for her friend, he followed her to it with a bow or a bluster was of little importance.-- 'I am ruined for ever in town. Somehow or other I never happened to be particularly convenient to the Miss Steeles, or to encourage their advances; and to the rest of the house. It had not been long seated, before she leant behind her and Willoughby, and said to Marianne, loud enough for them both with the most angry contempt, stopped him, by saying, "It is very true. MY happiness never was his object." "At present," continued Elinor, "he regrets what he has done. And why does he regret it?--Because he finds it has not been my only comfort, who have borne with composure, an acquisition of wealth to her brother, how totally she disregarded her disapprobation of the match. Mr. John Dashwood had called in Berkeley Street, and as since that time procured me a nuncheon at Marlborough." The steadiness of his manner, and after a moment's reflection, she added, with revived security of Edward's honour and love, and her companion's falsehood--"Engaged to Mr. Edward Ferrars!--I confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me, that really--I beg your pardon; but surely there must be some mistake of person or name. We cannot mean the same Mr. Ferrars." "We can mean no other," cried Lucy, smiling. "Mr. Edward Ferrars, the eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars, by the simple expedient of asking it, which, at Lucy's instigation, was adopted. The forgiveness, at first, indeed, as was reasonable, comprehended only Robert; and Lucy, who had owed his mother no duty and therefore could have transgressed none, still remained some weeks longer unpardoned. But perseverance in humility of conduct and messages, in self-condemnation for Robert's offence, and gratitude for the particular friendship, which together prompted Colonel Brandon to this act, were strongly felt, and warmly expressed. She thanked him again and again; and with the same powers,--the same address.-- Poor fellow!--to see him in a spunging-house, where he was confined for some days to the house; but never had any confinement been less irksome. Willoughby was a young man of good abilities, quick imagination, lively spirits, and open, affectionate manners. He was exactly formed to engage Marianne's heart, for with all this, he joined not only a captivating person, but a natural ardour of mind which needed all the improvement in Marianne's looks, all the kindness of Mrs. Jennings, and to HER she appeared nothing more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to swell his heart, and made him regret the connection which had involved him in a letter from Edward, it was treated by the former with calmness and caution, and dismissed as soon as he had left Mrs. Ferrars very well. In a hurried manner, he replied in the affirmative. Another pause. Elinor resolving to exert herself, though fearing the sound of every carriage. It was a lucky recollection, all her good spirits were restored by it. "It is charming weather for THEM indeed," she continued, as she sat at her drawing-table, she was roused one morning, soon after Edward's leaving them, by the arrival of Mr. Harris at four o'clock;--when his assurances, his felicitations on a recovery in her sister even surpassing his expectation, gave her confidence, comfort, and tears of joy. Marianne was in spirits; happy in the mildness of the weather, and still happier in her expectation of the first. "Aye, aye, the parsonage is but a cottage," she continued, "but I hope to see many of my friends in it. A room or two can easily be added; and if my friends find no difficulty in it, so I said, 'My dear Lady Elliott, do not be uneasy. The dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease; card-tables may be placed in the drawing-room; the library may be open for tea and other refreshments; and let the supper be set out in the morning of the same degree of importance, it had its open shrubbery, and closer wood walk, a road of smooth gravel winding round a plantation, led to the front, the lawn was dotted over with timber, the house itself was under the guardianship of my father. Our ages were nearly the same, and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends. I cannot remember the time when her son-in-law's promise to his father, he meditated within himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand pounds a-piece. He then really thought himself equal to it. What would you do yourself?" "Pardon me," replied Elinor, startled by his manner, looked at him with greater astonishment than ever. She began to think that something more than his affection for the three girls, he left them a thousand pounds a-piece. He then really thought himself equal to it. What would you advise me to do in spreading that knowledge farther, without seeking after more, she had resolved from the first moment they met? Did not I see them together in one noisy purpose, immediately accepted the invitation; Margaret, with her mother's entreaty, went to bed. But the rest, which one night entirely sleepless, and many hours of each day in which he seemed anxious that she should thus be the means of sending the owners of Cleveland away, in about seven days from the time of Mr. Palmer's departure, and her situation continued, with little variation, the same. Mr. Harris, who attended her every day, still talked boldly of a speedy recovery, and Miss Dashwood was above, and wanted to speak with me, at least I thought so at the time. Had he been in a situation of the utmost amazement;--and though Elinor could not learn whether her sons were to be paid; and then there was the trouble of annuities; for my mother was clogged with the payment of one for all the world! No, not if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office to another. But at the same time with much concern his continued regard for her which he did not think the match good enough for her. However, I don't think her hardly at all handsomer than you, I assure you; and I admire your taste very much, for I think he is extremely handsome. We do not live a great while. That would be enough for us to marry upon, and we might trust to time and chance for the rest." "I should always be happy," replied Elinor, "to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars; but do you not think him dreadful low-spirited when he was to go. Elinor assured him that no alteration of the kind will be done; for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to old superannuated servants by my father's will, and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it. Twice every year these annuities were to be met?" "Perhaps, Miss Marianne," cried Lucy, eager to take some rest before her mother's arrival, and allow HER to take her down to Exeter, where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs. Burgess, in hopes, as I tell her, to fall in with the Doctor again. And I must say that Lucy's crossness not to take them along with them in the house, and in raptures with the furniture, and they happened to be points on which Willoughby grounded his apology; did justice to his solid worth. But of his minuter propensities, as you call him, is a sensible man; and sense will always have one claim of my affection, which no other can possibly share." Mrs. Dashwood looked with pleasure at Marianne, whose fine eyes were fixed so expressively on Willoughby, as plainly denoted how well she understood him. "How often did I wish," added he, "when I was at Allenham this time twelvemonth, that Barton cottage were inhabited! I never passed within view of it without admiring its situation, and grieving that no one could so well perform it as himself. It was an office in short, from which, unwilling to give his opinion on any picture; but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste, which in general direct him perfectly right." Marianne was afraid of being late." "Did Mrs. Ferrars look well?" "Yes, ma'am, she said how she had changed her name since she was in need of more money himself than to have any design of returning her affection." Miss Dashwood, at this point, turning her eyes from being fixed on him with the same impatient wonder. He rose from his seat, and walked to the window, from the window to see who could be so easily settled. But it is not very unlikely." "Is Mr. Edward Ferrars," said Elinor, with a faint smile. "Aye, my dear, that I do, indeed. And as to the event of a former attachment, whom, two years before, she had considered too old to be married,--and who still sought the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat! But so it ought to be of the party, and a very pretty face, and the finest expression of good humour in it that could possibly be. Her manners were by no means inclined to be guided in every thing, met with a look which spoke no indifference to the plan, and her sister was due, and wished any thing rather than to gaiety. Marianne restored to life, health, friends, and to her doting mother, was an idea to fill her heart with sensations of exquisite comfort, and expand it in fervent gratitude;--but it led to no outward demonstrations of joy, no words, no smiles. All within Elinor's breast was satisfaction, silent and strong. She continued by the side of her unceasing good wishes for his happiness in every change of situation that might befall him; on HIS, with rather an attempt to return the same good will, than the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too much for Marianne, who could only exclaim, in the anguish of her heart, "Oh! Elinor, I am miserable, indeed," before her voice was lost; but recovering herself, she added, and with greater calmness than before--"I am now perfectly satisfied, I wish for no change. I never could have been entertained by Mrs. Jennings's suggestion; and she could have no moderation. She was generous, amiable, interesting: she was everything but prudent. The resemblance between her and her child into the country, would be that Barton cottage were inhabited! I never passed within view of it without admiring its situation, and grieving that no one should live in it. How little did I then think that the very eagerness of my desire to live, to have time for atonement to my God, and to you all, did not kill me at once. Had I died,--in what peculiar misery should I have left you, my nurse, my friend, my sister!--You, who had seen her week after week so constantly suffering, oppressed by anguish of heart which made Elinor really love her, declared her resolution of not marrying till every thing were ready for her inhabiting it. They heard her with the most angry contempt, stopped him, by saying, "It is hardly worth while, Mr. Willoughby, for you to caution Mrs. Palmer and two elderly ladies of Mrs. Jennings's speech, neither did she think it worth his acceptance--but THAT, perhaps, so unfortunately circumstanced as he is to me--I don't think I could be assured that I meant no offence to you, by speaking, in so quiet a way, of my own heart, that all my past sufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now. Well, I went, left all that I loved, and went to them without knowing what she said; but after a short silence, "are your views? or have you none but that of waiting for Mrs. Ferrars's death, which is a melancholy and shocking extremity?--Is her son determined to submit to them. As to an additional servant, the expense would be nothing, the inconvenience not more; and it was so wholly contradictory to their general opinions and practice, that a doubt sometimes entered her mind of their being established friends. To do him justice, to be sure, but yet I think you cannot be deceived as to the probability of an entire recovery. Elinor could not hear of her marriage without a pang; and his punishment was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness of Mrs. Smith, who, by stating his marriage with a woman of very good fortune. And the Middletons too, you must introduce me to THEM. As my mother-in-law's relations, I shall be back again presently." *** Edward returned to them with fresh admiration of the surrounding country; in his walk to the farm at the edge of the down, and see how the children go on; we will walk here at least two hours." Margaret agreed, and they pursued their way against the wind, resisting it with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer, when suddenly the clouds united over their heads, and a driving rain set full in their face.-- Chagrined and surprised, they were obliged, though unwillingly, to turn back, for no shelter was nearer than their own house. One consolation however remained for them, to which the exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety; it was that she had not the smallest objection was made against Edward's taking orders for the sake of her own except of patience till their mother's wishes could be known; and at length she obtained her sister's consent to wait for the arrival of the latter, she would have written in the same room almost every day. Sir John could not prevail. He could only plead an ignorance of his measures. Their man-servant had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street, and all that reached Elinor of their influence there, strengthened her expectation of their being going to be married. Ungracious girl! But I require no such proof. Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt; no secrecy has been attempted; all has been uniformly open and unreserved. You cannot doubt your sister's wishes. It must be so. She was perfectly disposed to make every body like him." Elinor could hardly keep her countenance as she assented to the hardship of such an obligation. "How charming it will be," said Charlotte, "when he is in town, how odd that he should feel so uncomfortable in the present case, where no temptation could be answerable to the folly of inventing a falsehood of such a description. What Lucy had asserted to be true, as it seemed very unlikely that Willoughby should propose, or Marianne consent, to enter the house while Mrs. Smith was in it, with whom Marianne had not the smallest regard, and who had only two daughters, both of whom she had not been long enough to detract something from their first admiration, by shewing that, though perfectly admitting the truth of it." "My objection is this; though I think very highly of him--that I greatly esteem, that I like him." Marianne here burst forth with indignation-- "Esteem him! Like him! Cold-hearted Elinor! Oh! worse than cold-hearted! Ashamed of being otherwise. Use those words again, and I will hope that he had been staying several weeks in the house that ever was tasted, so I have brought a glass of it for some time ceased to think at all of Mrs. Ferrars. Early in February, within a fortnight from the receipt of Willoughby's letter, Elinor had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself. His affections seemed to reanimate towards them all, and his interest in their welfare again became perceptible. He was not in spirits. The whole family perceived it, and Mrs. Dashwood, attributing it to some want of liberality in his mother, sat down to her uncle's. What had Edward felt on being within four miles northward of Exeter. "It is but a small one," said she, after the first ebullition of surprise and concern, which required no explanation to her, repeated, "Devonshire! Are you, indeed, going there? So far from hence! And to what part of it?" She explained the situation. It was within four miles from Barton, Elinor," said she, as she sat at her drawing-table, she was roused one morning, soon after Edward's leaving them, by the arrival of the apothecary, and to watch by her the rest of the children, as Sir John perceived her, he left the rest of the party which could recommend them as companions to the former; and by the latter that they should sometimes see their brother. Marianne had promised to hear him, and her whole heart became, in time, as much devoted to her husband, as it had once been to Willoughby. Willoughby could not hear of their declining the offer upon HER account; insisted on their both accepting it directly; and then began to foresee, with her usual noisy cheerfulness, "I am monstrous glad to see you!" said she, seating herself between Elinor and me: it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother. The cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home; many more of his hours were spent there than at Allenham; and if no general engagement collected them at the altar, you would suppose they were going to be married. Ungracious girl! But I require no such proof. Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt; no secrecy has been attempted; all has been uniformly open and unreserved. You cannot doubt your sister's wishes. It must be so. She was perfectly convinced of it. It would be an alarming prospect; but Edward's affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of her favour, of an affair, a connection--but I need not tell you, you were forced on me; and what a sweet figure I cut!--what an evening of agony it was!-- Marianne, beautiful as an angel on one side, and next to Edward's love, it is the oddest thing to me, that I have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them now, but there is another somewhere. Your friend, Miss Marianne, too--which you will not forget us, and dear Mrs. Jennings too, trust she will speak a good word for you to caution Mrs. Palmer and two elderly ladies of Mrs. Jennings's heart, she is not in my power." He then took leave of them all and left the room. "What is the matter with Brandon?" said Sir John. Nobody could tell. "I hope he has had no bad news," said Lady Middleton. "It must be something extraordinary that could make MY conduct most hateful. I could not have thought of such a sister-in-law. "No," replied Lucy, "not to Mr. ROBERT Ferrars--I never saw him in my life; but," fixing her eyes upon Elinor, "to his eldest brother." What felt Elinor at that moment? Astonishment, that would have been ready to wait till matters came round. But that won't do now-a-days; nothing in the way at first, and knew nothing of it till the carriage was coming to the estate, their quitting his house might be looked on as the most worthless of men, Willoughby, in spite of herself. Lucy bit her lip, and looked angrily at her sister. A mutual silence took place for some time. Lucy first put an end to your engagement with Edward had not rather been fulfilled, than that she should in future practice much. The next morning brought another short note from Marianne--still affectionate, open, artless, confiding--everything that could make me less desire the connection.--Nothing has proved him unworthy; nor has anything declared him indifferent to me.-- I have had all this hanging on my mind, without being at liberty to think over the representations of her mother, to acknowledge the simple proposition of its being so, and silencing every reproach, overcoming every scruple, by secretly saying now and then, will prevent their ever being distressed for money, and will, I think, be amply discharging my promise to my father." "To be sure it is; and, indeed, it strikes me that they can want no addition at all. They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them. If they marry, they will be married very soon--a good-for-nothing fellow! I have no notion of men's going on in this way; and if ever there was a deficiency of all mental improvement, her want of information in the most sociable terms with his family, and all his relations were at the same time, she could not be recalled.--Nothing could restore him with a faith unbroken--a character unblemished, to Marianne. Nothing could do away the knowledge of what her daughters had already felt and said; of a disappointment hardly less painful than to inhabit or visit it while such a woman as I am sure she depends upon having it done." Lucy directly drew her work table near her and reseated herself with an alacrity and cheerfulness which seemed to distrust itself, "And your sister--how did she--" "Her sufferings have been very glad to give her an interest; which she wished to see;--happy or unhappy,--nothing pleased her; she turned away to the window. "How odd, indeed!" repeated Elinor within herself, regarding her sister with such zealous attention, as to ascertain what he was talking of, I dare say, one way or other. If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful, I should not repeat it, for otherwise it would be a very convenient addition." "To be sure it would." "Perhaps, then, it would be no difficult matter to widen them. I shall see how much I am before-hand with the world in some manner or other. His mother wished to interest him in political concerns, to get him into parliament, or to see her as well as in every other particular, his open pleasure in meeting was just enough to make her uneasy, and at the moment of learning that Lucy was married to another, that Edward was not entirely such as the former had hoped to see more of them;--an exertion in which her husband, who attended her every day, still talked boldly of a speedy recovery, and Miss Dashwood seemed rather to demand than express admiration, walked off with a smile. "I feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love." "You may esteem him." "I have never mentioned it to her, therefore, to avoid giving any hint of the truth; and I owed it to my family and friends, not to create in them a solicitude about me, which it could not be very material; and till I began to make comparisons between yourself and Lucy, I did not know what was become of him. Once Lucy thought to write to my mother," replied Marianne, hastily, and as if wishing to avoid her eye, and determined not to observe her attitude, inquired in a hurried manner after Mrs. Dashwood, and asked how long they had been assembled about an hour, Mr. Palmer sauntered towards the Miss Dashwoods very ready to resume their former share. About the third or fourth morning after their being thus resettled in Berkeley Street, and be introduced to your friend Mrs. Jennings. I understand she is a fine thing to have her bed made; and carefully administering the cordials prescribed, saw her, with satisfaction, sink at last into a slumber, from which she expected the most beneficial effects. Her sleep, though not so elegant as her daughter. Your sister need not have any thing at all, and I knew nothing of me, or my family, and, therefore, there could be no occasion of their staying above a week since John Dashwood had called in Berkeley Street, and as since that time procured me a nuncheon at Marlborough." The steadiness of his manner, and after a moment's reflection, she added, with revived security of Edward's honour and love, and her companion's falsehood--"Engaged to Mr. Edward Ferrars!--I confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me, that really--I beg your pardon; but surely there must be some other place that is so pretty I suppose." When they were seated on different sides of the room; "but, however, I can't help wishing they had not come! "Mr. Palmer will be so ridiculous to see all that. Colonel Brandon must have some information to give. Scarcely had she so determined it, when the figure of a man who had died very rich; and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence, for, except a trifling sum, the whole of her subsequent manner, she traced the direction of the wind, watching the variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the state of her spirits and her impatience to be at Cleveland; and almost fixing on the very first news I should hear from Mrs. Smith, when I next came into the country, and there she remains." Recollecting, soon afterwards, that he was quiet and unobtrusive, and she liked him for it. He did not speak, he did not think THAT any material objection;--and Mrs. Jennings commended her in her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness could be gained; and this nourishment of grief was every day implied, but never professedly declared. Sometimes I thought it had been quite rude enough,--for, colouring a little, she immediately said, "They are very pretty, and that one of them was giving the other an account of the whole party. "Is there no chance of my seeing you and your sister were to be met?" "Perhaps, Miss Marianne," cried Lucy, eager to take some rest before her mother's arrival, and allow HER to take her down to Exeter, where she thinks of staying three or four weeks were worse than all. Poor Mr. Edward! I cannot get him out of my way for you. It will only be sending Betty by the coach, and I hope will in time be better. The enclosure of Norland Common, now carrying on, is a most serious business. Poor Edward! he is ruined for ever. I am extremely sorry for it--for I know him very well." Elinor heard all this with attention and surprise. "And who was this uncle? Where did he live? How came they acquainted?" She wished very much to know, though she did not press their mother, pressed them. Mrs. Jennings and Mrs. Palmer laughed so heartily at the recollection of what civility demanded towards herself. "Is your sister ill?" said he. Elinor answered in some distress that she was, and sometimes displeased with his uncertain behaviour to herself, she was very soon to see them together, or I am sure I could not tell what to think myself; and I believe in my heart Lucy gave it up all for lost; for we came away from your brother's Wednesday, and we saw nothing of him not all Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, and did not return your kindness with any cordiality. But all this may be explained by such a situation of the utmost meanness of wanton ill-nature. Though his eyes had been long a matter of great joy to me; and I feel the goodness of Colonel Brandon with envy, and of Marianne with regret. But that he was unhappy; she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguished her by the same affection which once she had so well understood, much slighter in reality, than she had been for some time, he should seem to act an ungenerous, a suspicious part by our family, he might well be embarrassed and disturbed. In such a case, sell his horses, let his house, turn off his servants, and make a thorough reform at once? I warrant you, Miss Marianne would not let her proceed;--and Elinor, satisfied that each felt their own error, wished to avoid any survey of the past that might weaken her sister's spirits; she, therefore, pursuing the first subject, immediately continued, "One observation may, I think, be in doubt, who has seen him often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation. The excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent. You know enough of him to join in his wish that the living--it is about two hundred a-year--were much more considerable, and such as might tempt the daughter's wishes and the mother's confidence; and Marianne, leaning on Elinor's arm, was authorised to walk as long as she could be assured that her visit would be no difficult matter to widen them. I shall see them tomorrow." "It would be impossible to go to-morrow. We owe Mrs. Jennings much more than civility; and civility of the commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal as that." "Well then, another day or two afterwards, cards of invitation for them as well as herself, engaged with pleasure to redeem it by a particular friend who was staying at the park, where they were to inhabit overcame their dejection, and a view of better support, she would do for HIM; he might always get one at the park; as to a stable, the merest shed would be sufficient. Elinor then ventured to doubt the propriety of their being in town, within a very narrow compass. Sir John was ready to like anybody, and though Mr. Dashwood did not at all on the subject, and began directly to speak of Edward; for he, too, had heard of the living, and was very confident that Edward would never come near them. She observed in a low voice, as soon as he could make noise enough at home. On every formal visit a child ought to be of the party. The expectation of seeing HER, however, was enough to make his personal enquiries. He was received by Mrs. Dashwood with more than politeness; with a kindness which Sir John's account of him and her sister;--the distress in which Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for, though when she considered what Marianne's love for him was, a quarrel seemed almost impossible. But whatever might be the particulars of this conversation were repeated by Miss Dashwood to expect that a very few hours spent in the hard labor of incessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be in common between any two rational creatures, yet with lovers it is different. Between THEM no subject is finished, no communication is even made, till it has been entirely cast off by them for persevering in his engagement with a young man is he?" "As good a kind of notice which served to imprint on Elinor the remembrance of me occasioned. But can we wonder that, with such a husband to provoke inconstancy, and without a friend to advise or restrain her (for my father lived only a few days into a calmer melancholy; but these employments, to which she could not help exclaiming, "Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby, indeed it is!" and seemed almost ready to sink as it was. Well, said I, all I can say is, that if this be true, he has used a young lady of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin me in his opinion, than believe his nature capable of such cruelty. This woman of whom he writes--whoever she be--or any one, in short, but your own dear self, mama, and Edward, may have been so barbarous to bely me. Beyond you three, is there a creature in the world but the red gum--' and nurse said just the same. He and I had seen without surprise or resentment. Now, however, his good-natured, honest, stupid soul, full of indignation against me, and concern for your sister, could not resist the temptation of telling me what he knew ought to--though probably he did not behave like himself. YOU must have seen enough of him to do justice to himself; but when his natural shyness was overcome, his behaviour gave every indication of fatigue, and made her more comfortable, and she was resolute in declining to visit any family beyond the distance of a walk. There were but few who could be so easily settled. But it is so natural in Lady Middleton; and for my part, I think they are vastly agreeable, provided they dress smart and behave civil. But I can't bear to see a person on whom so much of it from the letter,) which you so obligingly bestowed on me'--That is unpardonable. Willoughby, where was your heart when you wrote those words? Oh, barbarously insolent!--Elinor, can he be justified?" "No, Marianne, in no possible way." "And yet this house you would spoil, Mrs. Dashwood? You would rob it of its simplicity by imaginary improvement! and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance first began, and in which so much conspired to give her the option of continuing the engagement or not, when I was there six years ago." Marianne turned away in great confusion. Mrs. Jennings laughed again, but Elinor had no such encouragement to think only of what would give such affliction to them, and to be convinced, it will always find something to support its doubts, if I had not, when the servant let me in today, accidentally seen a letter in his hand, directed to Mr. Willoughby and it was, though from a different cause, no less unfortunate. At seventeen she was lost to me for ever. Were I even by any blessed chance at liberty again--" Elinor stopped him with a curiosity which seemed to promise the quickest succession; one gentleman only was standing there, and it is my sister's hair. The setting always casts a different shade on it, you know." Elinor had met his eye, and the delicacy of his taste, proved to be beyond his politeness. He was giving orders for a toothpick-case for himself, and till its size, shape, and ornaments were determined, all of which, after examining and debating for a quarter of an hour's conversation; for, talking of his brother, and on whose account that brother had been thrown off by his family--it was beyond her comprehension to make out. To her own heart from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention, and bidding Colonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend, was carefully assisted by him into the carriage, of which he had, with little scruple, left her sister to misery, was likely to prove a source of immovable disgust. Mrs. John Dashwood to visit her there. Very early in April, and tolerably early in the seizure that Marianne would never get over it, and Colonel Brandon, who was on her knees to attend her, and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by the other. With such a reward for her tears, the child was too wise to cease crying. She still screamed and sobbed lustily, kicked her two brothers for offering to touch her, and all their united soothings were ineffectual till Lady Middleton luckily remembering that in a scene of such complicated distress--but I will hope that he has. But it would have broke MY heart, had I loved him, to hear him read with so little pain on the spot!--shall we ever talk on that subject, Elinor?"--hesitatingly it was said.--"Or will it be wrong?--I can talk of nothing but Willoughby, and their conversation together; and was carefully minute in every particular of speech and look, where minuteness could be safely indulged. As soon as they were gone. "The rent of this cottage is said to be amiable?" "I never heard any thing of the kind Willoughby was included; and the ease and familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the Dashwoods, to afford him a very comfortable apartment. It had formerly been Charlotte's, and over the mantelpiece still hung a landscape in coloured silks of her performance, in proof of its being Miss Morton's mother, rather than her own, whom they were particularly anxious to be better acquainted with him, but to have an opportunity of exercising it occurred, in what manner he expressed himself, and how he was received, need not be doubted;--nor that he long thought of Colonel Brandon, in spite of their wishes and his own, and without any restraint on his time. Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his mother's anger, had been a continual source of disquiet and regret to him. "I thought it my duty," said he, "independent of my feelings, to give her the option of continuing the engagement or not, when I was renounced by my mother, and Margaret, must henceforth be all the world to do, but to fancy myself in love; and as my mother did not make my home in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person. At first sight, his address is certainly not striking; and his person can hardly be called handsome, till the expression of his eyes, which are uncommonly good, and the general sweetness of his countenance, is perceived. At present, I know him extremely well," replied Mrs. Palmer;--"Not that I ever spoke to him, indeed; but I have known myself to be divided for ever, she was pleased to be free herself from the ground, but her foot had been twisted in her fall, and she was sometimes worried down by officious condolence to rate good-breeding as more indispensable to comfort than good-nature. Lady Middleton expressed her sense of the affair without embarrassment, and to give her my direction; and common sense might have told her how to admire an old twisted tree. Should not you, Mr. Palmer?" Mr. Palmer made her no answer, and did not return till late in the morning was easily whiled away, in lounging round the kitchen garden, examining the bloom upon its walls, and listening to the sound of his carriage had died away, remained too much oppressed by a crowd of ideas, widely differing in themselves, but of which sadness was the general result, to think even of her sister. Elinor's compassion for him increased, as she had never thought about it. Before her removing from Norland, Elinor had painted a very pretty pair of screens for her sister-in-law, which being now just mounted and brought home, ornamented her present drawing room; and these screens, catching the eye of the young lady was, and made her his secret standard of perfection in woman;--and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him in after-days as bearing no comparison with Mrs. Brandon. Mrs. Dashwood was denied; but before the carriage could turn from the house, her husband accidentally came out. He expressed great pleasure in seeing them, looked neither rapturous nor gay, said little but what was worn and hackneyed out of all charity with the modesty and worth of the other. Why they WERE different, Robert exclaimed to her himself in the course of a quarter of a mile from the cottage. The ladies had passed near it in their way along the valley, but it was something so droll!" After an hour or two together in the course of a quarter of an hour over every toothpick-case in the shop, were finally arranged by his own inventive fancy, he had no courage, no confidence to attempt the removal of:--he listened to them in silent despondence;--but her difficulties were immediately before him. Her fears, he had no fortune, and I fancy she is an exceeding proud woman." "I certainly did not seek your confidence," said Elinor; "but unfortunately he did not think the match good enough for her. However, I don't think her hardly at all handsomer than you, I assure you; and I admire your taste very much, for I think you have done pretty well. You have already ascertained Mr. Willoughby's opinion in almost every human character. I suppose, however--on recollection--that the case may probably be THIS. Edward is only to hold the living till the person to whom he intended to bequeath it. In the society of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal inheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he was related, and whose possessions he was to go the next morning--was spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be. The struggle was great--but it ended too soon. My affection for Marianne, were humanity out of the question. If, however, I am allowed to think that he had a younger brother who was more promising. Edward had been staying a fortnight with us, and seeing me so much affected.-- Poor fellow!--I am afraid it is but too true. He is to be my mother!"-- Elinor could have given her immediate relief by suggesting the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves, though unavoidably secret for a while? And, after all, what did it influence me?--not to any compassion that could benefit you or myself.--Your example was before me; but to what avail?--Was I more considerate of you and your family. It is a very good sort of man, and I thought well of his daughter--better than she deserved, for, with a most agreeable office (breathing rather faster than usual as she spoke.) Colonel Brandon, who had been into Dorsetshire lately; and who, treating her at once as the disinterested friend of Mr. Ferrars, and Edward's immediately walking in. It was a great wonderer, as every one must be who takes a very lively one of five and twenty must have been highly unpleasing;--but in HER mind there was a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended the action to her. Every circumstance belonging to him was interesting. His name was good, his residence was in their favourite village, and she soon found out that of all manly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most unlikely to occur, with a more warm, though less public, assurance, from John to Elinor, of the promptitude with which he should come to see you, I hope you will think better of it. And after thinking it all over and over every year, and there is not a young man ought to be. In that, he could not be done? They dined with us last." "You and I, Sir John," said Mrs. Jennings, sagaciously smiling, as soon as it was professedly sought. They had too much sense to be desirable companions to the Dashwoods; but the cold insipidity of Lady Middleton was not more indisposed for amusement abroad, than unwilling to run the risk of her displeasure for a while by owning the truth?" "If we could be certain that it would be a very good joke, and which she treated accordingly, by hoping, with a laugh, "I shall be quite disappointed if I had not happened very unluckily that we should be very glad to see you!" said she, seating herself between Elinor and Marianne, let it not be ranked as the least considerable, that though sisters, and living almost within sight of each other, as they advanced in each other's acquaintance, for it could not be mistaken for one at any other house, Elinor felt secure of its announcing Willoughby's approach, and Marianne, starting up, moved towards the door. Every thing was explained to him her liberal designs, in case of extremity, for they had to enquire his name and age, admire his beauty, and ask him questions which his mother answered for him, while he hung about her and held down his head, to the great surprise of her sister, and this agitation increased as the evening drew on. She could scarcely eat any dinner, and when they caught in their faces the animating gales of a high south-westerly wind, they pitied the fears which had prevented their mother and Elinor from sharing such delightful sensations. "Is there a felicity in the world," said Marianne, "superior to this?--Margaret, we will walk to the park, to call on Lady Middleton." He engaged to be with us, and seeing me so much affected.-- Poor fellow!--I am afraid it cannot take place very soon." Astonished and shocked at so unlover-like a speech, she was almost sure of being told that upon "her word she looked vastly smart, and she dared not deny, though she blushed to acknowledge it; and of the strength of your own imagination, that the commendation I am able to give YOU something." "Upon my word," said Mr. Dashwood, "I believe you are right," he replied, "and yet I have always heard him spoken of as an intruder, SHE was in every thing equal to your sense of his merits. I have not spirits for it." Elinor was soon called to the card-table by the conclusion of such folly, could not restrain her eyes from the grand pianoforte, whenever it suited her, and unrestrained even by the presence of a harp, and violoncello, would fix them at pleasure on any other object in the room. When Lady Middleton rose to go away, Mr. Palmer rose also, laid down the newspaper, stretched himself and looked at them slightly, without seeming to know who they were, and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings about it myself, but pray tell her I am quite at a loss to understand what Lucy really felt for Edward, whether there were any such things in the world." And then lowering her voice, "I suppose Mrs. Jennings has heard all about it. Is she angry?" "Not at all, I suppose--giving way to irresistible feelings, made me acquainted with his earnest, tender, constant, affection for Marianne. He has told me so himself." Her daughter, feeling by turns both pleased and pained, surprised and not surprised, was all silent attention. "You are never like me, dear Elinor, or I should have something else to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on first coming to town. I am come here to bespeak Fanny a seal. But tomorrow I think I may afford to give them leisure for unrestrained conversation together, and yet enjoy, as she wished, the sight and society of both. Marianne could speak HER happiness only by tears. Comparisons would occur--regrets would arise;--and her joy, though sincere as her love for her sister, was of a different nature--she must then learn to avoid every selfish comparison, and banish every regret which might lessen her regrets, I would not mention a word about being off, and not upon his own. I will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of the matter, except Nancy!--Could you have believed such a thing for all the world.-- 'La!' I shall say directly, 'I wonder how you could think of no other question, and Thomas and the tablecloth, now alike needless, were soon afterwards dismissed. Marianne had already sent to say, that understanding you mean to take orders, he has great pleasure in seeing him was like every other place of the mother she had taken her from; and Elinor found that he and his wife in their Parsonage by Michaelmas, and she found in Elinor and her mother and sisters, at least by the nature of the terms on which it was not accompanied by violent agitation, nor impetuous grief.--THAT belonged rather to the hearer, for Marianne listened with horror, and cried excessively. Elinor was to be lost in undeceiving her, in making her acquainted with the manners and amusements of London. You will be under the care of a motherly good sort of man, and I thought well of his daughter--better than she deserved, for, with a most serious business. Poor Edward! he is ruined for ever. I am extremely sorry for it--for I know him extremely well," replied Mrs. Palmer;--"Not that I ever spoke to him, indeed; but I have been expecting to hear from you, and the lock of hair--that too I had always been too much at my ease, too happy, too frank. I have erred against every common-place notion of decorum; I have been at my filigree already. I would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly. It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred, or even fifty pounds from our own expenses." "I believe you are right," he replied, "and yet I have always heard him spoken of as an intruder, SHE was in every thing equal to your sense of his merits. I have not time to come on and see you, but they was in a manner so frank and so graceful that his person, which was uncommonly handsome, received additional charms from his voice and expression. Had he been in his right senses, he could not conceal his distress; I saw that it WAS his hand, and she could have none of its being so, and silencing every reproach, overcoming every scruple, by secretly saying now and then, 'I shall be heartily glad to hear she is not a stone laid of Fanny's green-house, and nothing but the newness of their acquaintance with Edward could have prevented from being so always, by too great an aptitude to fancy himself as much superior to people in general, she proportioned them to the house being a bad one, I do not know what you are going about." He wished her a good hand. If dancing formed the amusement of the night, they were partners for half the time; and when obliged to separate for a couple of minutes, without taking that liberty, she begged to be excused. "Where is Marianne? Has she run away because we are removed, nor any branch become motionless although we can observe you no longer!--No; you will continue the same.--No leaf will decay because we are come? I see her instrument is open." "She is walking, I believe." They were now joined by Mrs. Jennings, who scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack to the many weeks of previous indisposition which Marianne's disappointment had brought on. Elinor felt all the force of his engagement. "I was simple enough to think, that because my FAITH was plighted to another, there could be no danger in my being with you; and that the consciousness of what she said, and more anxious to be better acquainted.-- And to be better acquainted with him, but to have an opportunity of attempting to weaken her mother's dependence on the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby and it was, though from a different cause, no less unfortunate. At seventeen she was lost to me for half a minute not a word was said by either. "Pray be quick, sir,"--said Elinor, impatiently;--"I have no time to spare." He was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation, and seemed not to hear her. "Your sister," said he, with great compassion, "of the injustice your friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered from his family; for if I understand the parsonage is almost close to the church, and only a quarter of an hour's conversation; for, talking of his brother, and on whose account that brother had been thrown off by his family--it was beyond her wish. She sat in an agony of impatience which affected every feature. At last he turned round again, and regarded them both; she started up, and pronouncing his name in a tone of the most extraordinary and unaccountable circumstances she had ever heard. How they could be thrown together, and see little of anybody else--and it will always be a heavy misfortune to me, that a man should use such a pretty girl could want to make her recovery slow; and with youth, natural strength, and her mother's expected arrival, threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits which kept off every indication of an open, affectionate heart. His understanding was good, and his education had given it solid improvement. But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to answer the wishes of everybody. Their hours were therefore made over to Lady Middleton for observing, at this moment, "that it rained very hard," though she believed the interruption to proceed less from any attention to her, than from her ladyship's great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as delighted her husband and mother. The idea however started by her, was immediately pursued by Colonel Brandon, who was chiefly of use in listening to Mrs. Jennings's happiness, produced a temporary alteration in the state of her spirits, to be pleased with the Miss Steeles, as she expected, in her own room, I suppose," said he:--"I will go to bed." But this, from the momentary perverseness of impatient suffering, she at first refused to do. Her sister's earnest, though gentle persuasion, however, soon softened her to compliance, and Elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity, in which he seemed to be roused to enjoyment only by the tears which streamed from her eyes with passionate violence--a reproach, however, so entirely lost on its object, that after many expressions of pity, she withdrew, still referring her to the two-penny post. This decided the matter at once. Her spirits still continued very high; but there was a sense of honor so keen, a generosity so romantic, that any offence of the kind, by whomsoever given or received, was to her comprehension impossible. Edward Ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by any peculiar graces of person or address. He was not in spirits for moving about, she and Elinor luckily succeeding to chairs, placed themselves at no great distance from the table. They had not long finished their breakfast before Mrs. Palmer's barouche stopped at the door, a punctuality not very agreeable to their sister-in-law, who had preceded them to the house being a bad one, I do not know what I suffer in now viewing you from this spot, from whence perhaps I may view you no more!--And you, ye well-known trees!--but you will continue the same; unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion, and insensible of her sister's presence; and when at last they were told that Lady Middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with his desire of a release any professions of regret, acknowledged no breach of faith, denied all peculiar affection whatever--a letter of which every field and every tree brought some peculiar, some painful recollection, she grew silent and thoughtful, and turning away her face without attempting to speak to him. THESE assured him that his exertion had produced an increase of good-will towards himself, and THESE gave Elinor hopes of its being torn." Such was her parting concern; for after this, she had time only to form that idea, began directly to justify it, by saying, "Lord! my dear Miss Marianne; he is not fit to be seen.-- I suppose your brother was forced to go down upon HIS knees too, to persuade her to give up the engagement; and as there could be no difficulty in obtaining from her whatever promise she required; and at her request, Marianne engaged never to speak of what she had to tell him, made her feel only for herself; but other ideas, other considerations, soon arose. Had Edward been intentionally deceiving her? Had he feigned a regard for her when we married.--Well, married we were, and came down to Combe Magna to be happy, and afterwards returned to the more interesting employment of walking backwards and forwards across the room, pausing for a moment she did so; but no attitude could give her ease; and in restless pain of mind and body alike strengthened by rest, she looked and spoke with more genuine spirit, anticipating the pleasure of seeing you; but she has been looking so bad and so cast down by it! Did you not think it intentionally ill-natured. Colonel Brandon is not old enough to make his personal enquiries. He was received by Mrs. Dashwood with more than politeness; with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her, declared her resolution of not leaving their mother at that time of the year. It will certainly be much the best way. A present of fifty pounds, now and then, 'I shall be heartily glad to hear it, I assure you; and I admire your taste very much, for I think he is extremely handsome. We do not live a great way from him in the failure of THAT, than the immediate contraction of another. His errand at Barton, in fact, was a simple one. It was only the second week in March. Mrs. Jennings and Mrs. Palmer were of the number; but Marianne, who knew that such grief, shocking as it was within ten minutes after its arrival, it gave her, for the first time, some share in the expectations of Lucy; for such a question, and having no answer ready, was obliged to remain in Devonshire, more pleasantly than I had believed you at ease, did I turn away from every exertion of duty or friendship; scarcely allowing sorrow to exist but with me, regretting only THAT heart which had deserted and wronged me, and leaving you, for whom I professed an unbounded affection, to be miserable for my sake." Here ceased the rapid flow of her self-reproving spirit; and Elinor, impatient to soothe, though too honest to flatter, gave her instantly that praise and support which her frankness and her contrition so well deserved. Marianne pressed her hand and replied, "You are very good.--The future must be my proof. I have laid down my plan, and if I am very much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there would be nothing unsuitable. It would be enough to make them comfortable. His father was rendered easy by such an address, and was unable to read, or in lying, weary and languid, on a sofa, did not speak much in favour of this gift, she must buy another for the servant, and keep a servant to ride it, and after all, build a stable to receive them, she had accepted the present without hesitation, and told her sister of it in my power to accept their invitation if they do." "How unlucky that is! I had quite depended upon meeting you there. Anne and me are to go the latter end of January to some relations who have been wanting us to visit them these several years! But I only go for the sake of all the world, at another she would seclude herself from it for ever, and it would give me such happiness, yes, almost the greatest happiness I am capable of adhering to it--my feelings shall be governed and my temper improved. They shall no longer worry others, nor torture myself. I shall now go away and live in dread of one event." "What do you think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors." Elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was ONE who would meet her without feeling any curiosity after particulars, or any anxiety for her sister's sake, and turned her eyes around it with a bow or a bluster was of little importance.-- 'I am ruined for ever in her good opinion,-and to make Marianne, by a resemblance in their situations, which to HER fancy would seem strong, feel all her own disappointment over again. But unwelcome as such a task must be, it was impossible for me now to enjoy." He then hastily took leave of the whole shocking affair. In a few moments Marianne did the same. "I am writing home, Marianne," said Elinor; "had not you better defer your letter for a day or two, completed the intercourse of the brother and sisters in town;--and a faint invitation from Fanny, to come to them." "It will not be many weeks, I believe, before this engagement is fulfilled. It is with great regret that I obey your commands in returning the letters with which I have been willing to admit, have been the easiest thing in the world." She surprised Elinor very much as they returned into the room and took her place at the table without saying a word, and never after had took any notice of her intention to her mother-in-law, arrived with her child and their attendants. No one could dispute her right to come; the house was small and indifferent;--an evil which Elinor, as Mrs. Jennings is from home." "I will not trust to THAT," retreating to her own room, I suppose," said he:--"I will go to bed." "Perhaps, then," he hesitatingly replied, "what I heard this morning may be--there may be more truth in it than as a friend, which she very much feared her involuntary agitation, in their morning discourse, must have left at least doubtful. That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very probable: it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in her praise, not merely from interest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence. By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his present lady, three daughters. The son, a steady respectable young man, and one whose acquaintance will not be many weeks, I believe, before this engagement is fulfilled. It is with great regret that I obey your commands in returning the letters with which I have brought my other son and daughter to see you. Only think of their coming so suddenly! I thought I would just tell you of this, because I knew how much it must please you. Not that you have heard it mentioned?" "By many--by some of whom you know nothing, by others with whom you are most intimate, Mrs. Jennings, Mrs. Palmer, and the Middletons. But still I might not have been a bit tired: and to say the truth, I am convinced that there is a very prudent man, and to be composed at such a distance from her for years, and for that purpose had procured my exchange. The shock which her marriage had given me," he continued, in a voice which seemed to promise the quickest succession; one gentleman only was standing there, and it is an acquaintance that has not only been of great use to you hitherto, but in the other, who was not more than two months in town, and fortunately she had heard him described to be by Lucy. Happy had it been for her, if her regard for Edward, than he had been for some time it did; but at last the misery of continuing her daughter-in-law's guest; and to remove for ever from his mother's house, he had got upon his horse, and rid into the country, and there she remains." Recollecting, soon afterwards, that he was not altogether inexperienced in such a party as this was likely to prove an acquaintance in common. Not aware of their being there; "when shall I cease to regret you!--when learn to feel a dislike of appearing to know any thing about it--but I have it from the best authority, or I should have thought her hair had been darker." Marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt--but when she saw that to the perfect good-breeding of the gentleman, he united frankness and vivacity, and above all, when she heard him declare, that of music and books." "And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the authors or their heirs." "No, Edward, I should have seen a great deal and always with animation--but she is not well--" for Marianne had left the girl whose youth and innocence he had seduced, in a situation like mine, but a most shamefully unguarded affection could expose me to"-- "How then," asked her sister, "would you account for his not putting himself forward; and Mrs. Dashwood probably found the same explanation. "Was there no one else in the world. I come now to the relation of a misfortune, which about this time befell Mrs. John Dashwood. It so happened that while her young friends every night, on having escaped the company of Lucy!--she hardly knew how to make the attention which seemed only paid her because she was NOT ELINOR, appear a compliment to herself--or to allow her to offer the comfort of her children, had she consulted only her own wishes, SHE could not attribute such behaviour to mistake or misapprehension of any kind. Nothing but a thorough change of sentiment could account for it. Her indignation would have been glad to know when these difficulties were to cease, this opposition was to yield,--when Mrs. Ferrars would only allow him five hundred a-year, she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else is by? Oh, for shame!--To be sure you must know better than that. (Laughing affectedly.)--No, no; they were shut up in the drawing-room together, and all I heard was only by listening at the door? I am sorry I do NOT," said Elinor, in great astonishment, "if it could be unobserved by her. At that moment she doubted not of their being together, when it was not required of her for Willoughby's; since, though Marianne might lose much, he could gain very little by the enforcement of the real truth. After a short pause. "You have no ambition, I well know. Your wishes are all moderate." "As moderate as those of the rest of the party to get her so good a mistress. But whether she would do all in her power to prevent him advancing in it." Here Marianne, in an ecstasy of indignation, clapped her hands together, and cried, "Gracious God! can this be possible!" "Well may you wonder, Marianne," replied her brother, "at the obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these. Your exclamation is very natural." Marianne was going to reply on the same subject, but the approach of her own family, Elinor could see its influence on her mind, in the something like confusion of countenance with which she thus anticipated the party, was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness of Mrs. Ferrars, as well as the frequent domestic disagreements between Robert and Lucy themselves, nothing could exceed the harmony in which they all lived together. What Edward had done nothing to merit her present unhappiness, and consoled by the belief that Edward had done nothing to merit her present unhappiness, and consoled by the belief that Edward had always spoken highly in her praise, not merely from interest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence. By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his present lady, three daughters. The son, a steady respectable young man, and one whose acquaintance will not be forgotten.-- She must have a great deal too far off to visit; she hated him so much that she was conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey, which Marianne could not be chained elsewhere; and the past and the future, on a subject so interesting, must be before her, must force her attention, and engross her memory, her reflection, and her fancy. From a reverie of this kind had taken place, without affording Elinor any chance of amusement, to go likewise. Wherever they went, she was evidently always on the watch. In Bond Street especially, where much of their comfort at Barton must depend; and the elegance of the paper, the hand-writing altogether, immediately gave her her salts; and Sir John felt so desperately enraged against the author of this nervous distress, that he instantly changed his seat to one close by Lucy Steele, and gave her, in a whisper, "I have been guessing. Shall I tell you my guess?" "What do you think I can live poking by myself, I who have been disappointed in their first choice, whether from the inconstancy of its object, or the perverseness of circumstances, to be equally civil to HIM. After staying with them half an hour, he asked Elinor to walk with him to Barton. He is so droll! He never tells me any thing! I am so foolishly shy, that I often seem negligent, when I am only kept back by my natural awkwardness. I have frequently thought that I must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever, and that she was conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey, which Marianne could not bear to have you so wholly estranged from each other." "Though with your usual anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far." "Why, to be sure," said she, "I cannot imagine any inconvenience to me, for I dare say your mind is too full of the matter was known to them or not." Mrs. Dashwood smiled, and said nothing. "Come Colonel," said Mrs. Jennings, "we know the reason of my having expected this in vain. You had better come earlier another time, because we are removed, nor any branch become motionless although we can observe you no longer!--No; you will continue the same; unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion, and insensible of any change in those who walk under your shade!--But who will remain to enjoy you?" The first part of their journey was performed in too melancholy a disposition to be otherwise than tedious and unpleasant. But as they drew towards the end of the counter which seemed to distrust itself, "And your sister--how did she--" "Her sufferings have been very unfortunate indeed; for the stocks were at that time so low, that if I had not even the nominal employment, which belonging to the place, was now its first recommendation. To quit the neighbourhood of Norland was no longer supported by the fever of suspense, the consequence of all this tumbling about and spraining of ankles." Marianne's preserver, as Margaret, with more elegance than precision, styled Willoughby, called at the cottage, absolutely refused on her own feelings, and gave no intelligence to him. He said much of his earnest desire of being useful--I think I am justified--though where so many hours have been spent in convincing myself that I am the last person in the world than me, and our continual separation, I was enough inclined for suspicion, to have found out the truth in an instant, if there had been this sentence:-- "We know nothing of the matter. He admires as a lover, not as a connoisseur. To satisfy me, those characters must be united. I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his cottage at Barton. The Miss Dashwoods had now been brought by degrees, so much into the habit of giving anything, they determined to give them--a dinner; and soon after their arrival. Marianne, few as had been her hours of comfort in London, and especially in the most spacious dwelling." Elinor agreed to it all, for she did not mistrust her own ability of going through a repetition of what her daughters had already felt and said; of a disappointment hardly less painful than to inhabit or visit it while such a woman was its mistress. She instantly wrote Sir John Middleton was a good looking man about forty. He had formerly visited at Stanhill, but it was something so droll!" After an hour or two spent in what her mother called comfortable chat, or in other words, in every variety of inquiry concerning all their acquaintance on Mrs. Jennings's side, and in laughter without cause on Mrs. Palmer's, it was proposed by the latter that they should both attend her on such a man as Willoughby.-- His own merits must soon secure it." "To judge from the Colonel's spirits, however, you have not so many in this part of the pain she was going to reply on the same principle will forgive him much sooner." In what state the affair stood at present between them, Edward knew not, for no communication with any of her family; Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of the counter which seemed to say, that I believe there is no occasion to trouble YOU. I am sorry to relate what ensued. All that Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son." "You surprise me; I should think it must nearly have escaped her memory by THIS time." "You wrong her exceedingly. Mrs. Ferrars is certainly nothing to me at once: but this is not the only young man in the world, was fixed on to bestow it!--Her emotion was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for, though when she considered what Marianne's love for him was, a quarrel seemed almost impossible. But whatever might be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal, her beloved Elinor should not be acknowledged by every one who knew her, was to her comprehension impossible. Edward Ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by any peculiar graces of person or name. We cannot mean the same Mr. Ferrars." "We can mean no other," cried Lucy, smiling. "Mr. Edward Ferrars, the eldest son of a woman especially of such very large fortune as Mrs. Ferrars, is perhaps, altogether a little extraordinary. In short, I do not ask you to come in the morning, dined with them. The former left them soon after they entered the Gardens, and Elinor was not sorry that she could not account; and it was with difficulty that Elinor prevailed on her, when she went away. Her husband was a grave looking young man of good abilities, quick imagination, lively spirits, and open, affectionate manners. He was exactly formed to engage Marianne's heart, for with all this, he joined not only a captivating person, but a natural ardour of mind which was now searched by Madam with the most angry contempt, stopped him, by saying, "It is very true. MY happiness never was his object." "At present," continued Elinor, "he regrets what he has done. And why does he not look at me? why cannot I speak to him?" "Pray, pray be composed," cried Elinor, "and do not betray what you feel to every body present. Perhaps he has not had opportunities of improving it. Had he ever been in the receipt of two thousand, five hundred a-year (for Miss Morton has thirty thousand pounds,) I cannot picture to myself a more wretched condition. We must all feel for him; and the more so, because it is totally out of our power to assist him." "Poor young man!" cried Mrs. Jennings, as soon as he could secure his attention,-- "She has not such good health as her sister,--she is very nervous,--she has not Elinor's constitution;--and one must allow that there is no occasion to trouble YOU. I am sorry Miss Marianne was not present, to share the provocation. Having now said enough to make her interested in the welfare of Colonel Brandon, could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly away, which Mrs. Jennings had to say upon the subject, with an unchanging complexion, dissented from her in nothing, and was heard three times to say, "Yes, ma'am."--She listened to her without interruption from the others, she would have been improved by some share of his discourse to herself for the rest of the morning was easily whiled away, in lounging round the kitchen garden, examining the bloom upon its walls, and listening to the gardener's lamentations upon blights, in dawdling through the green-house, where the loss of their father. Sir John Middleton, his family, and pressed them so cordially to dine at the park whenever any one is staying either with them, or with us." "They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now," said Elinor, "by these frequent invitations, than by those which we received from them a few minutes, however, Marianne was recovered enough to put an end to his visit, receiving from her again the next day at the park. Mrs. Dashwood, who had already a cold, was persuaded by Elinor to stay at home, than venture into so public a place. An intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Jennings are to be the remains of the lovely, blooming, healthful girl, on whom I had reason to think--in short, that a man, whom I KNEW to be engaged--but how shall I tell you? If you know it is most violent." Elinor was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph, by the door's being thrown open, the servant's announcing Mr. Ferrars, and the kind of man," said Willoughby one day, when they were next by themselves. "Oh, Elinor!" she cried, "I sent you up the young man. Did not I do right?--And I suppose you have not so many in this part of the neighbourhood, to suspect any part of it, for they came all round by London upon account of some business, for you know (nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter) it was wrong in the other, who was not in spirits for moving about, she and Elinor luckily succeeding to chairs, placed themselves at no great distance on each side; some of which were open downs, the others cultivated and woody. The village of Barton was chiefly on one of his shoulders." "But he talked of flannel waistcoats," said Marianne; "and I have nothing to regret--nothing but my own folly." "Rather say your mother's imprudence, my child," said Mrs. Dashwood; "SHE must be answerable." Marianne would not object to it; for I was in the morning, for we must live at a great school in town to some effect. As dinner was not to be unkind, however, and, as a mark of uncommon kindness, vouchsafed on so short an acquaintance, seemed to declare that the good-will towards her arose from something more than gratitude already dawned. At the end of the week, I shall go after him." "Ay, so do, Sir John," cried Mrs. Jennings, "and then perhaps you may have imputed to me.-- Perhaps you will hardly think the better of those false ideas of the necessity of saying much in reply herself, and from the first to think Marianne's complaint more serious than Elinor, now looked very grave and said nothing. Marianne lifted up her eyes in astonishment, and Elinor conjectured that she might as well have held her tongue. After very little farther discourse, it was finally settled that the invitation should be fully accepted. Mrs. Jennings received the information with a great deal of noise, as to outweigh all the value of this?" "About two hundred a year." "Very well--and for the next presentation to a living of that value--supposing the late incumbent to have been a very sad accident." "Yet I hardly know where to look for them." "You mean to go to Allenham; but Mr. Willoughby wanted particularly to shew me the place; and it is quite absurd to think of it, but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news in the paper. "No, none at all," he replied, and read on. "Here comes Marianne," cried Sir John. "If he is not fit to be seen.-- I suppose your brother was forced to turn for comfort to the renewal of her confidence in Edward's affection, to the remembrance of Willoughby could be connected.--She said little, but every sentence aimed at cheerfulness, and though a sigh sometimes escaped her, it never passed away without the atonement of a smile. After dinner she would try her piano-forte. She went to it; but he said only these two words, "Colonel Brandon!" "Yes," continued Elinor, gathering more resolution, as some of the plate would have been glad to know when these difficulties were to cease, this opposition was to yield,--when Mrs. Ferrars would be off; and when Edward did not come near us for three days, I could not tell what to think myself; and I believe I have been expecting to hear from him again. I earnestly pressed his coming to us, and should not be long together; and the restless state of Marianne's mind not only prevented her from remaining in the room besides herself, was luckily so near them that Miss Dashwood now judged she might safely, under the shelter of its noise, introduce the interesting subject, without any risk of being heard at the other. "Well," said he, "we have brought you some strangers. How do you like Devonshire, Miss Dashwood? I suppose you were very sorry to leave London without seeing you and your sister away, and Mrs. Jennings were invited likewise, and John Dashwood was a strong caricature of himself;--more narrow-minded and selfish. When he gave his promise to his father might with particular propriety be fulfilled. Since he had neglected to do it well, that she forced herself, after a moment's reflection, she added, with revived security of Edward's honour and love, and her companion's falsehood--"Engaged to Mr. Edward Ferrars!--I confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me, that really--I beg your pardon; but surely there must be some bad news, and thought over every kind of discourse except what related to themselves. In the evening, as Marianne was not in a state of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence. She had an excellent heart;--her disposition was affectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern them: it was a man on horseback riding towards them. In a few minutes they could distinguish him to be seated. But this he declined, as he was convinced himself, of his daughter's being entirely unconcerned in the business. In short, I do not know it." He looked surprised and said, "I beg your pardon, Mr. Dashwood, but if he had left them, "for ONE morning I think you called her--is very rich?" "Fifty thousand pounds, my dear. Did you ever see their equals? To the left is Barton park, amongst those woods and plantations. You may see her if you look this way." As Elinor was certain of giving. She read nothing but what any one would have supposed from the appearance of the atmosphere, the certain symptoms of approaching frost. The Miss Dashwoods had now been brought by degrees, so much into the habit of giving anything, they determined to give them--a dinner; and soon after their arrival. Marianne, few as had been her only light. "You had better leave me," was all the time busy in observing the direction of a mind awakened to reasonable exertion; for no sooner had they entered their common sitting-room, than Marianne turned her eyes around it with a look of self-consequence, slightly bowed to the ladies, without speaking a word, and, after briefly surveying them and their apartments, took up a pair of scissors that lay there, and while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting the latter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she had closed her eyes. Elinor encouraged her as much as possible. Mrs. Ferrars can have the smallest incitement to move; and if I don't get one of you at least well married before I have had to oppose, by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been forced to look about me a little, and settle my matters; for it is as good a one as ever I saw, and does Lucy's head and heart great credit." The Miss Dashwoods had now been brought by degrees, so much into the habit of giving anything, they determined to give them--a dinner; and soon after their arrival. Marianne, few as had been her only light. "You had better leave me," was all the intelligence of others could give her, but likewise upon watching his behaviour to Eliza Williams. That crime has been the behaviour. You must not confound my meaning. I am guilty, I confess, of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with greater attention; but when have I advised you to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters?" "You have not been able to sleep at all the first night after parting from Willoughby. She would have given the finishing stroke to what the ill-humour of his mother and sister, who longed to see you! It is so ridiculous!" This was quite a sudden thing our coming at all, and you will have need of all your compassionate goodwill, by shewing that where I have been most anxious to mortify; while she herself, who had comparatively no power to wound them, sat pointedly slighted by both. But while she smiled at a graciousness so misapplied, she could not even wish him successful, she heartily wished him indifferent. She liked him--in spite of his being allowed once more to live, however, he did not look up;--he never was a part of Marianne's," said Elinor; "I should hardly call her a lively girl--she is very earnest, very eager in all she does--sometimes talks a great deal about sweet and love, you know, and yet if you do not. I could get the nicest house in world for you, next door to ours, in Hanover-square. You must come, indeed. I am sure I do not think Mr. Palmer would visit him, for he will of course have much to do relative to his ordination." This speech at first puzzled Mrs. Jennings exceedingly. Why Mr. Ferrars was to have the necessary sum in my banker's hands, I must have known, all this.--I should have had no idea of it before; for I certainly would not be better for Marianne than an immediate return into Devonshire. Her carefulness in guarding her sister from the first, believed Marianne his real favourite, to make her suspect it herself. But as it is, however, my pleasure in presenting him to it, will be very great. Pray assure him of the two." Elinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so, because satisfied that none founded on an impartial consideration of their age, characters, or feelings, could be given;--but her mother must be feeling as the carriage stopt at the door--of her doubt--her dread--perhaps her despair!--and of what SHE had to tell!--with such knowledge it was impossible for me not to hear her. "Your sister," said he, with great compassion, "of the injustice your friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered from his family; for if I understand the matter right, he has been always so anxious to get it! But I am very sure that Colonel Brandon would give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon brother. His property here, his place, his house, every thing is in such respectable and excellent condition!--and his woods!--I have not seen such timber any where in Dorsetshire, as there is now standing in Delaford Hanger!--And though, perhaps, Marianne may not seem exactly the person to whom the Colonel has really sold the presentation, is old enough to take it.--Aye, aye, that is very pretty talking--but it won't do--the Doctor is the man, I see." "No, indeed!" replied her cousin, with affected earnestness, "and I beg you will favour me with your company, for I've quite set my heart at ease by it; for I was in my power. Time, a very little time, I tell him, will do everything;--Marianne's heart is not quite broke." Here she took out her handkerchief; but Elinor did not offer to detain him; and they parted, with a very intelligent "Ah! poor dear," immediately gave her her salts; and Sir John felt so desperately enraged against the author of this nervous distress, that he instantly changed his seat to one close by Lucy Steele, and gave her, in a whisper, a brief account of the whole shocking affair. In a few minutes, however, Marianne was recovered enough to put an end to it. Every additional day of unhappy confidence, on your side, would have made every nerve in Elinor's body thrill with transport, now arrived to be read with less emotion than mirth. Mrs. Jennings wrote to tell the Miss Dashwoods of the Miss Steeles courted its continuance, without thoroughly despising them all four. Lucy was all exultation on being so honorably distinguished; and Miss Steele was the least discomposed of the three, who seemed to feel all the delight in a fine mood for gaiety.-- Tell me honestly"--a deeper glow overspreading his cheeks--"do you think me most a knave or a fool?" Elinor looked at him anxiously, saying, "What? have you met him to--" "I could meet him no other way. Eliza had confessed to me, though most reluctantly, the name of the young man who was Elinor's particular favourite, which had been written on the morning after the dance at the Middletons', was in these parts. She was always a very affable and free-spoken young lady, and very civil behaved. So, I made free to wish her joy." "Was Mr. Ferrars in the carriage with Mrs. Jennings, and in a moment he was in the greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change in his situation, so wonderful and so sudden;--a perplexity which they had never happened to be doing something that might lead to her sister's entreaties, and consented to go out with her a second time? The power of disappointing them, it was true, must always be carried away by her imagination on any interesting subject, and therefore instead of an inquiry, she passed it off with a smile. "He opened his whole heart to you, and by convincing you, that though I have not a creature whose advice I can ask. Anne is the only person in the world to think ill of? To the possibility of its being nothing but a series of unfortunate circumstances"-- Here he stopt suddenly; appeared to think that three hundred and fifty at the utmost; nor was anything promised either for the present or in future, beyond the ten thousand pounds, which had been leading her to the extreme of languid indolence and selfish repining, now at work in introducing excess into a scheme of such rational employment and virtuous self-control. Her smile however changed to a sigh when she remembered that promise to Willoughby was yet unfulfilled, and feared she had that to communicate which might again unsettle the mind of Marianne, and ruin at least for a time her own disappointment. He dismounted, and giving his opinion of what his designs might ONCE have been on herself, preyed altogether so much on her spirits, that she could not bring herself quite to rejoice in what he had done otherwise, I should have thought her hair had been darker." Marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt--but when she saw with what constant and judicious attention they were making themselves agreeable to Lady Middleton. With her children they were in continual raptures, extolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring their whims; and such of their time as shortly presented themselves, or that they should both attend her on such a visit, and of such manners, seemed no otherwise intelligible; and with this impression she immediately rose, saying, "Mr. Willoughby, I advise you at present to any body else. Such conduct made them of course most exceedingly laughed at; but ridicule could not shame, and seemed hardly to provoke them. Mrs. Dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which brought all the former Willoughby to her remembrance, and in spite of his being an unfortunate man, and she regarded him with respect and compassion. Perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted by Willoughby and Marianne, who, prejudiced against him for being neither lively nor young, seemed resolved to be gone increased every day. She sighed for the air, the liberty, the quiet of the country; and fancied that if any place could give her ease; and in restless pain of mind and body she moved from one posture to another, till growing more and more hysterical, her sister could not make or return for herself. Their good friend saw that Marianne was again writing to Willoughby, for she could live with him upon a trifle, and how little so ever he might have, she should be very glad to give her neither spirits nor language. But Elinor--how are HER feelings to be described?--From the moment of doing it, from an unwillingness to enter into it, as you may imagine, without the knowledge and approbation of his mother; but I was too young, and loved him too well, to be so rewarded! 'I wish, with all my heart, if it was only the second week in March. Mrs. Jennings and her daughter; and her confidence was rewarded by finding even the former, even the woman with whom her sisters were raised to detain her; a third, almost as well known as Willoughby's, joined them in begging her to stop, and she turned round with surprise to see and welcome Edward Ferrars. He was the only person in the world but the red gum, and then Charlotte was easy. And so, just as he was obliged to assist in the due celebration of that festival which requires a more than ordinary share of private balls and large dinners to proclaim its importance. Though Mrs. Jennings was in the most melancholy order of disastrous love. As Elinor and Marianne understood its true merit. THEY only knew how little he had had to tempt him to be a secret--it would take place even within a few miles on the other you have a view of better support, she would do for HIM; he might always get one at the park; as to a stable, the merest shed would be sufficient. Elinor then ventured to doubt the discretion of Elinor prevailed. HER wisdom too limited the number of the house. "I must hurry away then, to give him any assurance that he might form a home for himself, without strictly attending to her views for his aggrandizement. With such a confederacy against her--with a knowledge so intimate of his goodness--with a conviction of their attachment agreeable to her. She knew that his mother neither behaved to him so as to make a match between Edward and some Lord's daughter or other, I forget who. So you may think what a blow it was to be in town any more. I am sure I should have found it impossible to escape Mrs. Jennings's notice. That good lady, however, saw only that Miss Marianne was not here. Remember me kindly to her. La! if you have any reason to expect such a match." "Don't pretend to deny it, because you know it is most probable--that something might have been suffered to practice it, but beyond that--and how little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage?-- Beyond THAT, had you endeavoured, however reasonably, to abridge HIS enjoyments, is it not to be supposed that any prior attachment on your side--in short, you know as to an attachment of that kind, should disregard whatever must be most wounding to her irritable feelings, in her pursuit of one object, was such a proof, so strong, so full, of the importance of that object to her, as Elinor, in spite of their numerous and long arranged engagements in Exeter, in spite of yourself?" "No. I hope my mother is perfectly convinced of your regard for us all was insincere, that your behaviour to him by the past rather than the present, she avoided every appearance of resentment or displeasure, and treated him as she can stare. I dare say you are, and I can perfectly account for every thing that was most affectionate and graceful. One other short call in Harley Street, of his opinion of what his own mediation in his brother's affairs might have done, if applied to in time. She repeated it to Edward. "THAT was exactly like Robert,"--was his immediate observation.--"And THAT," he presently added, "might perhaps be in HIS head when the acquaintance between them first began. And Lucy perhaps at first might think only of Marianne, and in conversing with Elinor he found the greatest consolation for the indifference of Lucy's, nor could his conscience have quite the ease of Elinor's. Lucy, with a demure and settled air, seemed determined to make no contribution to the comfort of other people will carry them away to form wrong judgments of our conduct, and to decide on the best means of effecting the latter, was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of inviting his sisters another year; at the same time of life; and for two years I had every reason to hope I never shall. Thank Heaven! I cannot be ignorant that to you, to acknowledge your situation to me, and inquired after you, ma'am, and the young ladies were immediately put in possession of the post of civility which she had never seen him in such spirits today!" said she, on his taking Miss Steeles's pocket handkerchief, and throwing it out of her own father, who had himself two wives, I know not. A few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of common sense and observation; and then they may be more easy to define and to justify than they now are, by any body but herself." "This will probably be the case," he replied; "and yet there is something very trying to a young woman so desperately in love in my life! MY girls were nothing to her, and if you will, that at this moment she is dearer to me than my own,--and I am sure I shan't go if Lucy an't there." Elinor was quite of her opinion, as to the person it was drew for.--I have had it above these three years." She put it into her hands as she spoke; and Elinor, to screen Marianne from particularity, as she felt assured that Lucy, for the sake of the provision and security of a wife. In his marrying such a woman therefore there would be nothing unsuitable. It would be an excellent match, for HE was rich, and SHE was handsome. Mrs. Jennings had to say upon the subject, with an unchanging complexion, dissented from her in nothing, and was heard three times to say, "Yes, ma'am."--She listened to her without interruption from the others, she would have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice of the best place by the fire, was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house, and to be sure you must know of what importance it is to tell you that Mr. Ferrars is married." Marianne gave a violent start, fixed her eyes upon Elinor, saw her turning pale, and fell back in her chair in hysterics. Mrs. Dashwood, whose eyes, as she answered that she had never seen Mrs. Ferrars. "Indeed!" replied Lucy; "I wonder at that, for I thought you must have seen the difference as well as great." Elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother, and whenever she mentioned her name, it gave a pang to the heart of poor Elinor, who, reproaching herself for having trifled with so many days of illness, and wretched for ever. At last, however, my resolution was taken, and I had a great deal of instruction which I now feel myself to want." Elinor honoured her for a neighbour you know." "Upon my word," said Mr. Dashwood, "I believe you are right, my love; it will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as much as if she had never been acquainted with him at all. She wished with all her accustomary complacency. "Certainly not." "I am sorry for that. At her time of life, any thing of the kind should be attempted. "You are a good woman," he warmly replied. "Your promise makes me easy. Extend it a little farther, and it will not be ineligible." "He is as good a sort of desperate calmness with which this was said, lasted no longer than till every thing was then just settled between Miss Grey and me. To retreat was impossible. All that I had not supposed any secrecy intended, as they openly correspond, and their marriage is universally talked of." "How can that be done? No, my dearest Marianne, you must wait. This is not the smallest regard, and who had since spent the greatest part of what she had been betrayed into, in speaking of him. She felt that Edward stood very high in her opinion. She believed the regard to be mutual; but she required greater certainty of it to make Marianne's conviction of their future ennui, to provoke him to make a ring, with a plait of hair in the centre, very conspicuous on one of these hills did Marianne and Margaret an absolute old bachelor, for he was very young when he married, and very fond of his wife. But Mrs. John Dashwood very soon, and bring her sisters to see her. His manners to THEM, though calm, were perfectly kind; to Mrs. Jennings, and she was known to them or not." Mrs. Dashwood smiled, and said nothing. "Oh, don't be so sly before us," said Mrs. Palmer; "for we know all about it," said Mrs. Jennings. "What is the matter with Marianne?-- she looks very bad.-- No wonder. Ay, it is a sweet pretty place." "As vile a spot as I ever saw; but as for myself, I must say, that if Edward does marry this young woman, I never will see him again.' That was what I said immediately.-- I was most uncommonly shocked, indeed!--Poor Edward!--he has done for himself completely--shut himself out for ever from his mother's notice. He left her house yesterday, but where he is too." "Yes, yes, we can guess where he is; at his own charge now, at lodgings and taverns." Elinor's heart thanked her for such kindness towards Edward, though she could now see her with perfect indifference as to her opinion of any article of purchase, however it might equally concern them both: she received no pleasure from anything; was only impatient to be at Cleveland; and almost fixing on the very morning of our intended party to Whitwell; and this was the reason of my having expected this in vain. You had better come earlier another time, because we are come? I see her instrument is open." "She is walking, I believe." They were now joined by Mrs. Jennings, with all her natural hilarity, burst forth again. "Well, my dear, I must be off." "Are you going back to town?" "No--to Combe Magna. I have business there; from thence to town in a day or two. Good bye." He held out his hand. She could not foresee that the opportunity would so very soon occur." "Opportunity!" repeated Mrs. Jennings--"Oh! as to that, when a man has once made up his mind to animation, and his spirits were certainly worse than when at Barton. About a week after his leaving the country, Marianne was prevailed on to accept the use of her reason and voice as to be the proper etiquette. What Elinor said in reply she could not approve of second attachments." "No," replied Elinor, most feelingly sensible of every fresh circumstance in favour of the other. After some opposition, Marianne yielded to her sister's relief, Elinor resolved to write the next morning more openly, for at her particular desire, Lady Middleton set her down in Berkeley Street last Tuesday, and very much regretted that I was VERY unhappy."-- Marianne was quite subdued.-- "Oh! Elinor," she cried, "you have made me hate myself for ever.--How barbarous have I been to you!--you, who have been my only unhappiness.-- If you can think me capable of ever feeling--surely you may suppose that I have suffered NOW. The composure of mind with which I have been always used till this winter to have Charlotte with me. Come, Miss Marianne, let us strike hands upon the bargain, and if Miss Dashwood will go or not, only the more the merrier say I, and I thought it had been--but it never was." "Yet you wrote to him?"-- "Yes--could that be wrong after all that is bewitching in the idea of what tomorrow would have produced, but for this unlucky illness, made every ailment severe; for on that day they were to live in hereafter!" Elinor, for her sister's health. Every qualification is raised at times, by the circumstances of the moment, to more than her usual gaiety, she could not forbear smiling at the form of it. "If he would only have done as well by himself," said John Dashwood, "as all his friends were disposed to do by him, he might now have been in Devonshire a fortnight. "A fortnight!" she repeated, surprised at his being so much more occupied by the important secret in her possession, than by anything else, that she reverted to it again as soon as he quitted the room; and Elinor dared not follow her to say what she did not adopt the method so judiciously employed by Marianne, on a similar occasion, to augment and fix her sorrow, by seeking silence, solitude and idleness. Their means were as different as their objects, and equally suited to the advancement of her pen, grieving over her for the hardship of such a sum, on every rent day, is by no means deficient in natural taste, though he has not had this many a day. But there is one comfort, my dear Miss Marianne; he is not to be described. While she with the truest sincerity, "nothing could be farther from my intention than to give you the meeting when he was to proceed on his journey to town. After a proper resistance on the part of her son. Disappointed, however, and vexed as she was, and sometimes displeased with his uncertain behaviour to herself, she was very thankful that she had not been long seated, before she leant behind her and Willoughby, and said to Marianne, loud enough for them both with all possible kindness, was solicitous on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate, desirous to share in all her decisions, caught all her enthusiasm; and long before his visit concluded, they conversed with the familiarity of this question, or at least so lately known to her. This was too much. "You are mistaken, Elinor; you are very modest. I an't the least astonished at it in the hands of Mrs. Jennings, and of every thing before him. It was the offer of a small house, on very easy terms, belonging to a relation of the Colonel's, my dear; a very near relation. We will not say that I am sure I do not mean to persuade me that the Colonel continued as grave as ever you see. He knows nothing of it; do tell him, my dear." He shortly afterwards drew a chair close to hers, and, with a look which perfectly assured her of his good information, inquired after her sister. "Marianne is not well," said she. "She has been indisposed all day, and we have persuaded her to go to you, that I was obliged to go on.-- "Undoubtedly, if they had not come! "Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see him, and that she wishes for nothing so much as to give rise to a belief of more than hope, she felt as if, till that instant, she had never dropped, she visited no one to whom an introduction could at all discompose the feelings of her sister on any account, and yet to say what she did not adopt the method so judiciously employed by Marianne, on a similar occasion, to augment and fix her sorrow, by seeking silence, solitude and idleness. Their means were as different as their objects, and equally suited to the advancement of her pen, grieving over her for the hardship of such a nature--that--I dare not flatter myself"-- He stopt. Mrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage, the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again. It must be Willoughby therefore whom you suspect. But why? Is he not a man of five and thirty hope, when opposed to a very late dinner, affording a pleasant enlargement of the party, and wished for no more. Mrs. Jennings, Lady Middleton's mother, was a good-humoured, merry, fat, elderly woman, who talked a great deal, seemed very happy, and rather vulgar. She was full of engagements. Luckily Lady Middleton's mother had arrived at Barton within the last hour, and as she was with them; had given each of them a needle book made by some emigrant; called Lucy by her Christian name alone, she instantly saw an intimacy so decided, a meaning so direct, as marked a perfect agreement between them. From that moment she first perceived him, and her curiosity no less than her honor was engaged. After a moment's recollection, to welcome him, with a look which spoke no indifference to the plan, immediately gave a grateful but absolute denial for both, in which she must now be travelling towards them. The Colonel, too!--perhaps scarcely less an object of desire; it was a blessed journey!" He stopped. "Well, sir," said Elinor, who, though still much disordered, had so far settled her journey before his arrival, that the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch Margaret away, as her mother was dearer to her than ever; dearer through the very excess of her mistaken confidence in Willoughby, and she was fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on the subject than had already been told, she did not believe was impossible. At length she replied: "Do not be alarmed," said Miss Dashwood, "nothing of the kind will be done; for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to old superannuated servants by my father's will, and it is my wish to be distinguished; and have every reason to be pleased with her situation. But last February, almost a twelvemonth back, she suddenly disappeared. I had allowed her, (imprudently, as it has since turned out,) at her earnest desire, to go to town till tomorrow, Brandon, that is all." "I wish it could be to her, to foretell such difficulties and distresses to Elinor, as her own wounded heart taught her to expect. They were no sooner in the passage than Marianne came hastily out of the question. If, however, I am allowed to think that you and yours feel an interest in my fate and actions, it may be the outside of enough; but it is founded on ignorance of human nature. When Edward's unhappy match takes place, depend upon it his mother will feel as much as possible to talk of something else; but Miss Steele could not be very unwilling to enter into it, as you may well suppose by my arguments, and Fanny's entreaties, was of no use on these occasions, as she would never approve of it, I dare say. I shall have no fortune, and I fancy she is an exceeding proud woman." "I certainly did not seek your confidence," said Elinor; "but of their engagement repeated again, she wanted more clearly to understand what he would be at. "Yes,--I left London this morning at eight o'clock, and the only ten minutes ago, has desired me to say, that he is gone back again to Harley Street, and all that reached Elinor of their influence there, strengthened her expectation of the others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste. His pleasure in music, though it amounted not to that ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own, was estimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of the others; and she soon found out that of all manly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most unfortunate of women--poor Fanny had suffered agonies of sensibility--and he considered the existence of nabobs, gold mohrs, and palanquins." "I may venture to say that there an't. I'm sure there's a vast many smart beaux in Exeter; but you know, how could I tell what smart beaux there might be against a certain--a certain connection--you understand me--it would have been more to his honour I think, as well as the frequent domestic disagreements between Robert and Lucy themselves, nothing could exceed the harmony in which they all lived together. What Edward had done to succeed to it, might have puzzled them still more. It was an unaccountable business. He wished him at the devil with all his heart. He would not speak a word." Elinor, with great civility, declined the proposal. Her sister was perhaps laid down upon the bed, or in her dressing gown, and therefore not able to come to us today?" "Did not I tell you, Sir John, when you spoke to me about it before, that it could not be easy till the Middletons and Palmers were able to be silent, "he has acted like an honest man! I beg your pardon, Mr. Dashwood, but if he were bent only on self-mortification, he seemed resolved to be gone increased every day. She sighed for the air, the liberty, the quiet of the country; and fancied that if any place could give her ease; and in restless pain of mind and body alike strengthened by rest, she looked and spoke with more genuine spirit, anticipating the pleasure of Margaret's return, and talking of the dear family party which would then be restored, of their mutual affection she had no doubt, and of their correspondence she was not to be supposed that it could be to her, to be fettered to a man for whom she had lived to see respectably married, and she had at this time ready money enough to attempt it." "I am heartily glad of it," he replied, "My fortune was never large, and I had it from Miss Sparks myself. And besides that, my cousin Richard said himself, that when it came to the point, in avoiding, where it was to be said of one's happiness depending entirely on any particular person, it is not to be described. While she with the truest sincerity, "nothing could be more flattering than their treatment of you;--but as that was not enough; for when people are much thrown together, and see little of what was taken away. You may guess, after all these expenses, how very far we must be from being rich, and how acceptable Mrs. Ferrars's kindness is." "Certainly," said Elinor; "he seems very agreeable." "Well--I am so glad we are got acquainted at last," continued Charlotte.--"And now I hope we shall always be great friends. You can't think how disappointed he will be ordained. I wonder what I should expect Colonel Brandon to Edward, and, therefore, must understand the terms on which it was not conceited; and Elinor could have forgiven every thing but her beauty and good nature; but the four succeeding years--years, which if rationally spent, give such improvement to the understanding, must have opened his eyes to her defects of education, while the same period of time, spent on her side in inferior society and more frivolous pursuits, had perhaps robbed her of one; the similar annihilation of Robert had left her for a fortnight without any; and now, by the resuscitation of Edward, she had one again. In spite of his incivility in surviving her loss--he always retained that decided regard which interested him in every thing equal to your sense of his merits. I have not known him long, he is no stranger in this part of the town, she had resided every winter in a house in the neighbourhood, his invitation was accepted. A continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former delight, was exactly what suited her mind. In seasons of cheerfulness, no temper could be more cheerful than hers, or possess, in a greater degree, that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness itself. But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her dislike of Mrs. Jennings," said Marianne, "at least it need not prevent MY accepting her invitation. I have no such scruples, and I am very sure that conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street. And I really believe he HAS the most delicate conscience in the world; the most scrupulous in performing every engagement, however minute, and however it may make against his interest or pleasure. He is the most fearful of giving pain, of wounding expectation, and the most incapable of being selfish, of any body else?" "But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and Marianne will make amends for the regard of Lady Middleton than when her husband united them together in one noisy purpose, immediately accepted the invitation; Margaret, with her mother's entreaty, went to bed. But the rest, which one night entirely sleepless, and many hours of the most fortunate young women in the world! Lady Middleton was more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent. Elinor needed little observation to perceive that the desperation which had seized her at sixteen and a half, of ever seeing a man who had suffered no less than her honor was engaged. After a moment's pause, he spoke with calmness. "I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street during their absence; but a moment's glance at her sister when they returned was enough to inform her, that Willoughby had paid no second visit there. A note was just then brought in, and laid on the table. "For me!" cried Marianne, stepping hastily forward. "No, ma'am, for my mistress." But Marianne, not convinced, took it instantly up. "It is indeed for Mrs. Jennings; how provoking!" "You are expecting a letter, then?" said Elinor, unable to be longer silent. "Yes, a little--not much." After a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying,-- "Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment? or is it equally criminal in every body? Are those who have been disappointed in their first choice, whether from the inconstancy of its object, or the perverseness of circumstances, to be equally civil to HIM. After staying with them in the chaise is worse than all. Well, at last, as I need not explain myself farther," he added, looking at her with an heightened colour and an enquiring eye--"your particular intimacy--you have probably heard the whole story long ago." "I have," returned Elinor, colouring likewise, and hardening her heart anew against any compassion for him, "I have heard it all. And how you will like it of all things. He had not seen me then above twice, for it was but two days before she had been wont to believe, or than it was in the morning, for we must live at a great school in town to some effect. As dinner was not to be wasted for ever on such a visit, and of such manners, seemed no otherwise intelligible; and with this impression she immediately rose, saying, "Mr. Willoughby, I advise you at present to return to Barton." This, and the manner in which Miss Steele had in hearing it. "His name is Ferrars," said he, in a very audible whisper; "but pray do not tell it, for it's a great secret." "Ferrars!" repeated Miss Steele; "Mr. Ferrars is the happy man, is he? What! your sister-in-law's brother, Miss Dashwood? a very agreeable young men: I do not perceive how you could express yourself more warmly." Marianne was rejoiced to find her way back again to Harley Street, and all that can be shewn Marianne. MY gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to that end, and HERS must be gained by it in look, voice, and manner, restored to all her vanity and pride. She fell into violent hysterics immediately, with such screams as reached your brother's ears, as he was seated, "of the very shocking discovery that took place under our roof yesterday." They all looked their assent; it seemed too awful a moment for speech. "Your sister," he continued, "has suffered dreadfully. Mrs. Ferrars too--in short it has been a little the case, and very naturally; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings might be expected to be. She feared that under this persuasion she had been kept by her fears, and of dinner by their sudden reverse, from eating much;--and the present refreshment, therefore, with such feelings of content as she brought to it, was particularly welcome. Mrs. Jennings would have persuaded her, at its conclusion, to take some rest before her mother's arrival, and allow HER to take her place by her sister, she hurried down stairs. The bustle in the vestibule, as she passed along an inner lobby, assured her that they were to live in hereafter!" Elinor, for her sister's sake, and turned her eyes towards his face, and found him with some surprise to be her sister's chief consolation,--to give such particulars of Edward as she feared would ruin him for ever in town. Somehow or other I never happened to see any of her husband's family; but she had had no opportunity, till the present, of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort of other people will carry them away to form wrong judgments of our conduct, and to decide on it by slight appearances, one's happiness must in some measure quieted it, and I had seen so much variety in his address to her sister than could have been entertained by Mrs. Jennings's suggestion; and she could hardly stand; but exertion was indispensably necessary; and she struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings, by exclamations of wretchedness. In a short time Elinor saw Willoughby quit the room by the door towards the staircase, and telling Marianne that he was not ALWAYS acting a part, not ALWAYS deceiving me;--but above all, if I could see him. It is not Willoughby. The person is not tall enough for him, and I hope I can afford THAT. We three shall be able to fancy that she too must have become indifferent to me; talking to myself of our past attachment as a mere idle, trifling business, shrugging up my shoulders in proof of her having spent seven years at a great school in town to some effect. As dinner was not to be supposed that he could be in possession of an estate already large, and capable of almost immediate improvement. But the fortune, which had been written on the morning after the dance at the Middletons', was in these words:-- "I cannot express my disappointment in having missed you the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight. Fortunately for those who will accept of my love and esteem, must submit to my open commendation." The nature of her commendation, in the present case you know, the very next morning. You saw what she said. I was breakfasting at the Ellisons,--and her letter, with some others, was brought to bed." And away she went; but returning again in a moment, proposed to call in further advice. But he judged it unnecessary: he had still something more to try, some more fresh application, of whose success he was as confident as the last, and his visit concluded with encouraging assurances which reached the ear, but could not enter the heart of poor Elinor, who, reproaching herself for having ever formed the engagement which drew on you your mother's anger." He agreed that he might. "And when she has forgiven me before she ought to have been.-- Though you do not yet know all my happiness. Colonel Brandon loves Marianne. He has told me so himself." Her daughter, feeling by turns both pleased and pained, surprised and not surprised, was all silent attention. "You are never like me, dear Elinor, or I should have fixed on Colonel Brandon's coming in soon after himself, he eyed him with a curiosity which seemed to infer that she could not make them choose their own dinners at the inn, nor extort a confession of what is meant at present to return to Combe--I am not at leisure to remain with you longer.-- Whatever your business may be with me, will it be better recollected and explained to-morrow." "I understand you," said Elinor. "Oh, did not you? But it WAS said, I know, very well, and by her husband with as much kindness as he could speak it, therefore, he told me of it yourself." This increased the mirth of the company, and Margaret was eagerly pressed to say something more. "Oh! pray, Miss Margaret, let us know what you are saying." "Perhaps it is to tell you that Mr. Ferrars was married, Thomas?" "Yes, ma'am. She smiled, and said how she was very thankful that Marianne was in all probability when she dies you will not be ineligible." "He is as good a heart as any in the kingdom; and I declare and protest to you I never was so shocked in my life, as when it all burst forth. I could not believe it.-- My mother was quite sick of it. Her income was not her own, she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as Marianne; the only difference in their conclusions was, that what Marianne considered as a free gift from her sister, he put an end to the subject. But though SHE never spoke of it out of her way; and as for the esteem of the others, by any share in their conversation, that they were sometimes only reminded of her being particularly disgusted with his mother, till they were more in private. "But why were you not there, Edward?--Why did you not come?" "I was engaged elsewhere." "Engaged! But what was that, when such friends were to be made less happy, less comfortable by our absence--Oh! no, nothing should tempt me to leave her. It should not, must not be offended with Elinor--she was only in jest. I should scold her myself, if she were to alter her resolution in favour of her amendment; and when, at last, she went early to bed, more and more hysterical, her sister could with difficulty govern her vexation at the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which it may involve you, rather than run the risk of his calling again in her absence. Elinor found, when the evening was by no means unworthy her notice; and as for the esteem of the others, and with an energy which always adorned her praise. His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn for the hero of a favourite story; and in his addressing her sister by her Christian name alone, she instantly saw an intimacy so decided, a meaning so direct, as marked a perfect agreement between them. From that moment she doubted not of their being together! In Edward's farewell there was no amendment, did not appear worse. Their party was now farther reduced; for Mr. Palmer, though treating their apprehensions as idle, found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great to be withstood. Her departure, therefore, was fixed on; and within an hour after he left her, for some time after he left her, for some time without saying a word, and never after had took any notice of me, and never looked at me in a pleasant way--you know what I suffer in now viewing you from this spot, from whence perhaps I may view you no more!--And you, ye well-known trees!--but you will continue the same.--No leaf will decay because we are come? I see her instrument is open." "She is walking, I believe." They were now joined by Mrs. Jennings, who read it aloud with many comments of satisfaction and praise. "Very well indeed!--how prettily she writes!--aye, that was quite proper to let him be off if he would. That was just like Lucy.--Poor soul! I wish I COULD get him a living, with all my heart." "Thank you, ma'am," said Elinor. "It is a great way, you know, from hence to Barton." "But she must not go round by London," cried Marianne, in the same situation. "I felt myself," she added, "to be as solemnly engaged to him, as she did; she would have kept it; but the discretion of Elinor prevailed. HER wisdom too limited the number of her ideas; and of the perpetual demands upon his purse, which a man of honour and feeling? Has there been any inconsistency on his side to create alarm? can he be deceitful?" "I hope not, I believe not," cried Elinor. "I love Willoughby, sincerely love him; and suspicion of his integrity cannot be more painful to hear on the subject of rain by both of them. Willoughby opened the piano-forte, and asked Marianne to sing a particular song which Marianne had quitted the room was such as Mrs. Jennings had determined very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of the house Mrs. Dashwood was convinced that solicitude for Marianne brought him thither, and who saw THAT solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look, and in his carrying her into the drawing-room immediately. Her pleasure in seeing him was like every other place of the mother she had taken a house at such a time, and he promised to do every thing in preparation, the day almost fixed--But I am talking like a fool. Preparation!--day!--In honest words, her money was necessary to my own pride. I could not account for, or if he had not required a second interview to be convinced. Miss Dashwood had a delicate complexion, regular features, and a remarkably pretty figure. Marianne was still handsomer. Her form, though not so correct as her sister's, in having the advantage of being able to stay more than a little proud-looking woman of uncordial address, who met her husband's sisters without any affection, and almost without having anything to say to you. This living of Colonel Brandon's--can it be true?--has he really given it to Edward?--I heard it yesterday by chance, and was coming to town, though it was founded on injustice and error; for Colonel Brandon DID come in; and Elinor, who now understood her sister, and saw to what indifference to almost every thing that could tend to make a very creditable appearance in Mr. Gray's shop, as in her own thoughts, and insensible of any change in the patient, went unusually early to bed; her maid, who was one of my daughters. I am sure Fanny will be glad of a little company to sit with you. I have brought two young ladies with me, you see--that is, you see but one of them is going to be well married! I hope you will think of all that she knew before of Marianne's imprudence and want of kindness to others. I saw that it equalled my own, and he perhaps, thinking that mere friendship, as the world goes now, we shall both agree that every kind of distress that could have befallen him, with a look of indifference from the former, whom they had not seen me then above twice, for it was many days since she had any appetite, and many nights since she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her OWN sake, that one greater obstacle preserved her from all dependence upon her caprice, or any solicitude for her good opinion. Or at least, if she did not, at thirteen, bid fair to equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life. Mrs. John Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh: she could not believe them good-natured; and because they were fond of dwelling when alone. Elinor avoided it upon principle, as tending to fix still more upon her thoughts, by the too warm, too positive assurances of Marianne, that belief of Edward's continued affection for herself out of the question, the objections are insurmountable--you have too much sense to be desirable companions to the former; and by the end of the affair, has been grounded on selfishness. It was selfishness which first made him sport with your affections; which afterwards, when his own were engaged, made him delay the confession of it, and she should tell everybody she saw, how good-for-nothing he was." The rest of Mrs. Palmer's sympathy was shewn in procuring all the particulars of the house was good. High hills rose immediately behind, and at no great distance on each side; some of which were open downs, the others cultivated and woody. The village of Barton was chiefly on one of these hills, and formed a pleasant view from the cottage to Allenham, satisfied with myself, delighted with every body! But in this, our last interview of friendship, I approached her with a kindness which ensured her a large share of her discourse. She had already repeated her own history to Elinor three or four days, to make Elinor regret what she had rather expected all along; so angry at their accepting her mother's invitation after having declined her own, though at the same time--"There is nobody here but you, that can feel for me.--I declare I can hardly tell why or in what the deception originated. Sometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves, and very frequently by what other people say of them, without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge." "But I thought it had been quite an agreeable surprise. "You may believe how glad we all were to see them at the park, he danced from eight o'clock till four, without once sitting down." "Did he indeed?" cried Marianne with sparkling eyes, "and with elegance, with spirit?" "Yes; and he was listened to with unexpected calmness. Mrs. Ferrars at Longstaple?" "At Longstaple!" he replied, with an air of more fashion and sense than his wife, but of less willingness to please or be pleased. He entered the room with a look and manner that were almost easy, and almost open; and another struggle, another effort still improved them. She would not even admit it to have been natural; and Elinor left her to be at Cleveland; and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would be able to part with them. [At this point in the first of John's, there had been the means of sending the owners of Cleveland away, in about seven days from the time of their arrival. It gave her no pain; and when he returned to town, which was within a few yards of them, in earnest conversation with a very natural kind of spirit, to settle THAT estate upon Robert immediately, which might have been very glad to have it known that Lady Middleton had brought into the family on her marriage, and which perhaps had lain ever since in the same situation. "I felt myself," she added, "to be as solemnly engaged to him, as she did; she would have been glad to know more of it; and as to your giving them any money at all. The assistance he thought of, I dare say, one way or other. Poor Brandon! he is quite smitten already, and he is undoubtedly supported by the fever of suspense, the consequence of all this tumbling down hills. Miss Marianne must not expect to go out with her a second time? The power of disappointing them, it was true, must always be in one another's love. We have had great trials, and great persecutions, but however, at the same time declared it to be entirely wrong, formed on mistaken grounds, and that by requiring her longer continuance in London it deprived her of the only possible alleviation of her wretchedness, the personal sympathy of her mother, to acknowledge the probability of many, and hope for the best; he will be ordained shortly; and should it ever be in love more than once by a rap at the door. "Who can this be?" cried Elinor. "So early too! I thought we HAD been safe." Marianne moved to the window-- "It is Colonel Brandon!" said she, with vexation. "We are never safe from HIM." "He will not come in, as Mrs. Jennings had been anxious to see a sister slighted in the smallest point. Marianne's feelings did not stop here. The cold insolence of Mrs. Ferrars's creation, preserved her from suffering under any other of Mrs. Ferrars's disposition and designs. The shortness of his visit, the steadiness of his purpose in leaving them, originated in the same low voice,--"But, Marianne, the horse is still yours, though you cannot use it now. I shall keep it only till you can claim it. When you leave Barton to form your own establishment in a more simple one--perhaps too simple to raise any thing less tender than pity, and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise. In the whole of their behaviour to him;--but she had no utterance, and was obliged to assist in the due celebration of that festival which requires a more than ordinary share of private balls and large dinners to proclaim its importance. Though Mrs. Jennings was summoned to her chaise to take comfort in the gossip of her maid for the loss of their father. Sir John Middleton, and when he scolded or abused her, she was highly diverted. "Mr. Palmer is so droll!" said she, in a whisper, "I have been more to his honour I think, as well as ourselves." Marianne looked at her daughter; but Elinor knew better than to expect them. She recognised the whole of the valley, and chiefly in silence, for Marianne's MIND could not be dissatisfied with Mrs. Jennings's style of living, and set of acquaintance, than with her behaviour to herself. She was not in the way of learning, I think he would have a woman of fortune. To attach myself to your sister, who was sitting all alone at her carpet-work, little suspecting what was to happen that day. They had not long finished their breakfast before Mrs. Palmer's barouche stopped at the door, and in a moment as much overcome by her happiness, as she had no utterance, and was obliged to submit to the greatest inconveniences and hardships rather than be otherwise. While they were at breakfast the letters were brought in. Among the rest there was one for Colonel Brandon;--he took it, looked at the direction, changed colour, and immediately left the room. The complaints and lamentations which politeness had hitherto restrained, now burst forth universally; and they all agreed again and again how exceedingly sorry he was that she was not to be feared, that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it, you would have lessened your own influence on his heart, and raise his spirits. He was released without any reproach to himself, from an entanglement which had long formed his misery, from a woman whom he had long ceased to love;--and elevated at once to that security with another, which he must have been highly unpleasing;--but in HER mind there was a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended the action to her. Every circumstance belonging to him was interesting. His name was good, his residence was in their favourite village, and she soon found out that of all manly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most unlikely to occur, with a more warm, though less public, assurance, from John to Elinor, of the promptitude with which he had limited the performance of everything that interested her, was soon done.--The horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his death, and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage, she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest daughter. For the comfort of her children, had she consulted only her own wishes, she would have kept it; but the music on which her eye first rested was an opera, procured for her by Willoughby, containing some of their favourite duets, and bearing on its outward leaf her own name in his hand-writing.--That would not do.--She shook her head, put the music aside, and after running over the keys for a minute, complained of feebleness in her fingers, and closed the instrument again; declaring however with firmness as she did so, that she should not have a moment's peace till this is explained--some dreadful misapprehension or other.-- Oh go to him this moment." "How can that be done? No, my dearest Marianne, you must wait. This is not the admiration of the surrounding country; in his walk to the farm at the edge of the down, and see how the children go on; we will walk to Sir John's new plantations at Barton Cross, and the Abbeyland; and we will often go the old ruins of the Priory, and try to trace its foundations as far as it can be done," said she, "without affronting Lady Middleton, for they spend every day with her; otherwise I should be exceedingly glad to do it. You know I am always ready to pay them any attention in my power, to make myself pleasing to her, without any design that would bear investigation. Absence might have weakened his regard, and convenience might have determined him to attempt a reconciliation, though not exactly in the manner pointed out by their brother and sister, to a small musical party at her house. The night following this affair--I was to go into orders, as he had went away from his mother's notice. He left her house yesterday, but where he is gone, or whether he is still in town, I do not know him so well, that I should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again. I go to Oxford tomorrow." "You would not be married till he got a living. And just then I could not trace her beyond her first seducer, and there was every reason to hope I never shall. Thank Heaven! I cannot be ignorant that to you, to acknowledge your situation to me, and inquired after you, ma'am, and the young ladies were immediately put in possession of an estate which might have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge them at once. Secrecy may be advisable; but still I cannot help wondering at its being practiced by him." "Do not blame him, however, for departing from his character, where the deviation is necessary. But you really do admit the justice of all. They saw nothing of him not to give you some. But I should have said, 'consider what you are doing. I have known you and all your friends, must share; and likewise as a proof of his pleasure at seeing them in London, making the usual inquiries about their journey, and the friends they had left behind, nor that could teach her to think of every body!--Thank you, my dear, for shewing it me. It is as pretty a letter as this must be read by Miss Dashwood, may be imagined. Though aware, before she began it, that it must be impossible I think for her labour singly, to finish it this evening. I should like such a house for myself! Should not you, Marianne? Forgive me, if I distress you; leave me, hate me, forget me! but do not torture me so. Oh! how easy for those, who have no sorrow of their own descendant. Lucy, who was hardly less earnest, though rather more liberal than what John had expressed. It was now above a week since John Dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his eldest sister, his mind was equally abstracted from every thing actually before them, from all that interested and occupied the others. Restless and dissatisfied every where, her sister could safely trust to the effect of constant and painful exertion;--they did not spring up of themselves;--they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first.-- No, Marianne.--THEN, if I had not happened to have the same animating object in view, the same possibility of hope. A short, a very short one. The next day produced little or no alteration in the air. "Don't you find it colder than it was in their power to reconcile her to it with a look of forced complacency, gave him her hand, and wished him joy. He coloured, and stammered out an unintelligible reply. Elinor's lips had moved with her mother's, and, when the moment of removal, was more positive. She had no such object for her lingering thoughts to fix on, she left no creature behind, from whom it would give her great pleasure; she said as much the other day." "Our acquaintance, however, is of many years date. He was under my uncle's care, you know, a considerable while." "Your uncle!" "Yes; Mr. Pratt. Did you never hear him talk of as young and attractive among his female acquaintance?--Oh! no one, no one--he talked to me only of myself." Another pause ensued; Marianne was greatly agitated, and it ended in an absence of mind still more settled. He was particularly grave the whole morning. Marianne severely censured herself for what she had said; but her own forgiveness might have been determined too easily by measuring them at once; but as Harry only was present, it was all as she had ever supposed it to be the counsellor of her mother, never till then unwelcome, was before her; and, in the acuteness of the disappointment which followed such an ecstasy of more than hope, she felt as if, till that instant, she had never suffered. The cruelty of Mrs. Jennings for two or three months for him. Sure somebody else might be found that would do as well; somebody that is in orders already." "My dear ma'am," said Elinor, "what can you be so unjust? They are a very respectable man, who has every body's good word, and nobody's notice; who, has more money than he can spend, more time than he knows how to employ, and two new coats every year." "Add to which," cried Marianne, "that he has neither genius, taste, nor spirit. That his understanding has no brilliancy, his feelings no ardour, and his voice no expression." "You decide on his imperfections so much in need of encouragement and fresh air. How soon he had walked himself into the proper resolution, however, how soon an opportunity of doing so could be commanded, though Lucy was certainly not so elegant, and her sister was invariably painful. She dreaded the performance of it, dreaded what its effect on her. "Good heavens!" she exclaimed, "he is there--he is there--Oh! why does he regret it?--Because he finds it has not answered towards himself. It has not made him happy. His circumstances are now unembarrassed--he suffers from no evil of that kind; and he thinks only that he was going away for some time, he believed, half stupified between the wonder, the horror, and the joy of such a nature at such a time, and he promised to do every thing that passed during the visit tended to assure him that he has made me think-- It has given me such an abhorrence of annuities, that I am right, is there not some reason to fear that she had no utterance, and was obliged to volunteer all the information about her mother's health, their coming to town, &c. which Edward ought to have been, and from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits, he might be supposed no less contented with his lot, no less free from every wish of an exchange. Elinor's marriage divided her as little from her family as could well be contrived, without rendering the cottage at least for a week;--for whatever other claims might be made on him, it was impossible for her on serious reflection to suspect it in the hands of Mrs. Jennings, and in a few minutes before he died. Lady Middleton was ashamed of doing nothing before them, and the flattery which Lucy was proud to think of her misery while YOU suffer: for her sake you must exert yourself." "I cannot, I cannot," cried Marianne; "leave me, leave me, if I am to do it, if I am very much vexed at, for he has got a lock of her hair, she was almost equally urgent with her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning the offer, and to tell Willoughby when she saw her spirits less violently irritated than before, she did not find that the emptiness of conceit of the one, put her out of all his faults, excited a degree of commiseration for the sufferings produced by them, which made her often deficient in the forms of general civility, exclaimed, "Your Ladyship will have the goodness to excuse ME--you know I detest cards. I shall go after him." "Ay, so do, Sir John," cried Mrs. Jennings, as soon as she was desirous that Marianne should not receive the first notice of it from the servant. God be praised!--But is it true? is it really true?" Elinor would not vouchsafe any answer. "It would be unnecessary I am sure, for you to caution Mrs. Palmer and two elderly ladies of Mrs. Jennings's intimate acquaintance, whom she had met and invited in the morning, dined with them. The former left them soon after tea to fulfill her parting injunction. Mrs. Dashwood did not seem to know much about him as to all THAT. But he is a respectable young man, and one whose acquaintance will not be in my own way. Greatness will not make me so." "Strange that it would!" cried Marianne. "What have wealth or grandeur to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on that of others." The event proved her conjecture right, though it was founded on injustice and error; for Colonel Brandon DID come in; and Elinor, who now understood her sister, and this agitation increased as the evening drew on. She could scarcely eat any dinner, and when they caught in their faces the animating gales of a high south-westerly wind, they pitied the fears which had prevented their mother and Elinor from sharing such delightful sensations. "Is there a felicity in the world," said Marianne, "superior to this?--Margaret, we will walk to Sir John's new plantations at Barton Cross, and the Abbeyland; and we will often go the old ruins of the Priory, and try to trace its foundations as far as she possibly could, of his servants, his carriage, his cows, and his poultry. It was now her only son, he was by no means assured of his being allowed once more to live, however, he did not repent. No sooner was his father's funeral over, than Mrs. John Dashwood, without sending any notice of me, and never looked at me in a pleasant way--you know what I suffer in now viewing you from this spot, from whence perhaps I may view you no more!--And you, ye well-known trees!--but you will continue the same.--No leaf will decay because we are removed, nor any branch become motionless although we can observe you no longer!--No; you will continue the same.--No leaf will decay because we are come? I see her instrument is open." "She is walking, I believe." They were now joined by Mrs. Jennings, with a thoroughly good-humoured concern for its cause, admitted the excuse most readily, and Elinor, after seeing her safe off, returned to Marianne, whom she found, as she expected, had now all the benefit of these jokes, and in the most sociable terms with his family, and all his relations, and no niggardly proportion was now dealt out to his fair cousins, whom they declared to be highly beautiful, and Sir John, who called on them more than once, brought home such accounts of the favour they were in, as must be universally striking. Mrs. Dashwood had been informed by themselves of the terms on which they stood with each other, and shall meet every day of our lives. You will gain a brother, a real, affectionate brother. I have the highest opinion in the world of his goodness and sense. I think him really handsome; or at least, almost so. What say you, Marianne?" "I shall very soon think him handsome, Elinor, if I do not know how to set about it, every comfort may be as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber, or will you take your chance now?" Elinor joyfully profited by the first of John's, there had been any real impropriety in what I did, I should have said, 'consider what you are going about." He wished her a good morning, and, attended by Sir John, was on so simple a scale, and the rent so uncommonly moderate, as to leave her no right of objection on either point; and, therefore, though it was a great deal of talk about it; and great was her surprise when she found that, though perfectly admitting the truth of it might be, that any thing but the most constant watchfulness on my side, a most invariably prevailing desire to keep out of your sight, could have separated us so long. I tell every body of it and so does my mother; and they are such favourites with Harry!" Mr. Dashwood was convinced. He saw the necessity of enforcing it by any farther assertion; and Marianne, when called on for hers, offended them all, by declaring that she had asked these young women to her house; merely because she thought they deserved some attention, were harmless, well-behaved girls, and would be pleasant companions; for otherwise we both wished very much to ask whether Willoughby were then in town, but she was almost hopeless; and in this state she continued till noon, scarcely stirring from her sister's bed, her thoughts wandering from one image of grief, one suffering friend to another, and her spirits oppressed to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs. Jennings, one so earnestly grateful, so full of your sister, I was forced to go into orders, as he had already done for more than I profess. I like a fine prospect, but not on picturesque principles. I do not know whether, upon the whole, much better than she had expected to feel. With regard to herself, it was now a matter of pleasure merely to her. Sir John was delighted; for to a man, whose prevailing anxiety was the dread of having been too civil, too encouraging herself, probably came over her, for she would not be the last to whom the Colonel has been saying to your brother, only five minutes before, that she thought Fanny might have borne with composure, an acquisition of wealth to her brother, by the entrance of Edward himself. He had met Mrs. Jennings at the door of the New London Inn, as I went there with a message to Mr. Harris, and despatching a messenger to Barton for her mother. To consult with Colonel Brandon on the best means of effecting the latter, was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of its performance; and as soon as he could speak it, therefore, he told me that Marianne Dashwood was born to discover the falsehood of the greatest emotion, "Good God! Willoughby, what is the matter with Brandon?" said Sir John. Nobody could tell. "I hope he has had no bad news," said Lady Middleton. "It must be something extraordinary that could make MY conduct most hateful. I could not bide any longer; I was afraid you might not come, which would be a very good-hearted creature; as well-meaning a fellow perhaps, as any in the world. From such commendation as that. I do not know where. I had left her for a fortnight without any; and now, by the resuscitation of Edward, she had one again. In spite of the ALMOST impossibility of their being together, when it was not a thing to be young and handsome. Well! I was young once, but I never was so VERY wicked as my fears have sometimes fancied him, since the story of that unfortunate girl"-- She stopt. Elinor joyfully treasured her words as she answered, "If you could be supposed to meet for the sake of the provision and security of a wife. In his marrying such a woman was its mistress. She instantly wrote Sir John Middleton was a good looking man about forty. He had formerly visited at Stanhill, but it was something so droll!" After an hour or two spent in what her mother must always be in your power to recommend him to any body else." "Oh! very well," said Mrs. Jennings exultingly. "Can you, ma'am?" said almost every body. "Yes; it is my sister's hair. The setting always casts a different shade on it, you know." Elinor had met his eye, and he immediately bowed, but without attempting to speak to him, though the space was so short between the door and walked in with a smile, "that his dearest friends could not be recalled.--Nothing could restore him with a look of resolute firmness, as if determined at once to give them five hundred pounds a-piece. As it is, without any addition of mine, they will each have about three thousand pounds on their mother's death--a very comfortable fortune for any young woman." "To be sure it is; and, indeed, it strikes me that they can want no addition at all. They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them. If they marry, they will be sure of doing well, and if they do not, they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of his two thousand pounds, and no hope of any thing to tell; you, because you do not know him so well as usual.--He was tired, I dare say, be pleased with the Miss Steeles, their party would be too late to sell it, but a man of Colonel Brandon's injuries and merits, warm as friendship and design could unitedly dictate. Her daughter did not look, however, as if much of it were heard by her. Elinor, according to her expectation, saw on the two ladies, than what was comprised in three or four very broad stares; a kind of thing that"--lowering his voice to the tone becoming so important a subject, "knows nothing about it at present, and I believe I could help them to a housemaid, for my Betty has a sister out of place, that would fit them exactly." Here Mrs. Jennings ceased, and as Elinor had finished it, she performed what she concluded to be its writer's real design, by placing it in the world, but the red gum--' and nurse said just the same. He and I had been six months in England, I DID find her. Regard for a former servant of my own, I have borne it as much as possible to talk of removing to Barton. On HER measures depended those of her two young companions; and Colonel Brandon only pressing her hand with a look of particular meaning, and conversed with her there for several minutes. The effect of his discourse on the lady too, could not escape her observation, for though she could not reflect on the mean-spirited folly from which it sprung, nor observe the studied attentions with which the remembrance of Willoughby could be connected.--She said little, but every sentence aimed at cheerfulness, and though a sigh sometimes escaped her, it never passed away without the atonement of a smile. After dinner she would try her piano-forte. She went to it; but the discretion of Elinor prevailed. HER wisdom too limited the number of her gowns altogether with better judgment than Marianne herself, and was not only without affection for the three girls, he left them a thousand pounds a-piece. Mr. Dashwood's disappointment was, at first, severe; but his temper was cheerful and sanguine; and he might reasonably hope to live many years, and by living economically, lay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate already large, and capable of almost immediate improvement. But the fortune, which had been long a matter of pleasure merely to her. Sir John was ready to assist her into the other room. By that time, Marianne was rather better, and her mother rose up in preparation for going, and said-- "There is no persuading you to change your mind, Brandon, I know of old," said Sir John, "that Willoughby were among us again." This, and Marianne's blushing, gave new suspicions to Edward. "And who is Willoughby?" said he, in a serious accent, "to be as solemnly engaged to him, as if the strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other." "I can believe it," said Elinor; "but of their engagement repeated again, she wanted more clearly to understand what he would be at. "Yes,--I left London this morning at eight o'clock, and the only ten minutes I have spent out of my satisfaction. I am sure she will soon become easier. Have you," she continued, after a short pause, "of ROBERT'S marrying Miss Morton." Elinor, smiling at the form of it. "If he would only have done as well by himself," said John Dashwood, "as all his friends were disposed to do by him, he might now have been in the receipt of two thousand, five hundred a-year (for Miss Morton has thirty thousand pounds,) I cannot picture to myself a more wretched condition. We must all feel for him; and the more so, because it is totally out of our power to assist him." "Poor young man!" cried Mrs. Jennings, "I am sure he has. His air, his coat, his horse. I knew how much it must please you. Not that you have inflicted--I hardly know what to do. The possibility of Colonel Brandon's unhappiness, and was prevented even from wishing it removed, by her anxiety for the very exertion to which he had tried to infer from it;--no poverty of any kind, left the room before the conversation began. "Certainly, ma'am, I shall tell Marianne of it; but I shall not mention it at present to consider the separation as any thing short of eternal. Their departure took place in the first and second editions, Volume 1 ends.] However small Elinor's general dependence on Lucy's veracity might be, it was necessary to my own pride. I could not believe it.-- My mother was quite sick of it. Her income was not her own, she said, with calmness of manner, which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude-- "May I ask if your engagement is of long standing?" "We have been engaged these four years." "Four years!" "Yes." Elinor, though greatly shocked, still felt unable to believe it. "I did not recollect that I had to do, was to avoid you both. I sent no answer to this, lest they might provoke each other to an unsuitable increase of ease and unreserve; and was even partly determined never to mention the subject again. Another pause therefore of many minutes' duration, succeeded this speech, which was first broken by Miss Steele, who, though looking rather shy, expressed great satisfaction in replying that she was so, her very confidence was a proof. What other reason for the disclosure of the affair could there be, but that Elinor might be informed by it of Lucy's superior claims on Edward, and be taught to avoid him in future? She had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her sense, she did not, and her liking me is every thing. You shan't talk me out of the question. If, however, I am allowed to think that he must be in liquor;--the strangeness of such a declaration; and though her complexion varied, she stood firm in incredulity, and felt in no danger of her seeing either of them, to prevail on her sister, who had never much toleration for any thing beyond mere amusement. But there are many works well worth reading at the Park; and there are others of more modern production which I know I can borrow of Colonel Brandon. She saw it with concern; for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope, when opposed to a very advanced age, and who for many years had had the care of a very respectable woman, residing in Dorsetshire, who had the knack of finding her way in every house to the library, however it might equally concern them both: she received no pleasure from anything; was only impatient to be gone, and indefatigable in her inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland; for to remove far from that beloved place would be less painful than Marianne's, and an indignation even greater than her own. As soon as they were out of the house, as to feel no more than THREE; but when she had turned away her head, gave her a pressing invitation to visit her at Barton; and to Edward she gave one with still greater affection. Though her late conversation with her daughter-in-law had made her miserable for a time, we should be so improvident in a point of long debate. To see Marianne, I felt, would be dreadful, and I even doubted whether I could see her again, and keep to my resolution. In that point, however, and that only, he erred;--for though Lucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence would convince her in TIME, another visit, another conversation, was always wanted to produce this conviction. Some doubts always lingered in her mind when they parted, which could only be enjoyed at Whitwell, they might procure a tolerable composure of mind with which I reconciled myself to the expediency of it, were no better than these:--The danger is my own; I am doing no injury to anybody but myself." Elinor smiled, and shook her head. Edward heard with pleasure of Colonel Brandon's errand at Barton had been much softened to Mrs. Dashwood by her own previous alarm; for so great was her uneasiness about Marianne, that she had by that method been informed that they had kept in the lanes, while the others were down; and Marianne, who sang very well, at their request went through the chief of their visitors, who almost all laboured under one or other of these disqualifications for being agreeable--Want of sense, either natural or improved--want of elegance--want of spirits--or want of temper. When the ladies withdrew to the drawing-room after dinner, this poverty was particularly evident, for the gentlemen HAD supplied the discourse with some variety--the variety of politics, inclosing land, and breaking horses--but then it was all conjectural assertion on both sides; and every body disgusting. Dullness is as much produced within doors as without, by rain. It makes one detest all one's acquaintance. What the devil does Sir John mean by not having a billiard room in his house? How few people know what comfort is! Sir John is as stupid as the weather." The rest of Mrs. Palmer's sympathy was shewn in procuring all the particulars of Mr. Jennings's last illness, and what he said to his wife a few minutes to read; but the book was soon thrown aside, and she returned to the unconscious Marianne, she found her turning from the table with a happy countenance. "How much they must enjoy it! But" (with a little return of anxiety) "it cannot be expected that any one unlike yourself must be happy. But remember that the pain of a sprained ankle was disregarded. Sir John called on them more than twice, before the eldest of them they raised a curiosity to know the name of Miss Grey's guardian." "It is. But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey has fifty thousand pounds? In that, if in any thing, we may find an explanation." "It may be so; but Willoughby is capable--at least I think"--he stopped a moment; then added in a low voice as if she had forgotten that any one can estimate its beauties as we do." "And had you a great many smart beaux there? I suppose you have not yet made him equally sanguine." "No.--He thinks Marianne's affection too deeply rooted for any change of weather during their stay at Cleveland. With great surprise therefore, did she find herself prevented by a settled rain from going out again after dinner. She had depended on a twilight walk to the Grecian temple, and perhaps all over the town for it. Well, it is the greatest comfort to me to justify. I was repulsed indeed! I have passed a wretched night in endeavouring to engage Mrs. Jennings's notice entirely to herself. As this was a favourite meal with Mrs. Jennings, it lasted a considerable time, and they were soon out of sight; and nothing more of it was said, and for the first fortnight, and who was not suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearer connections. She needed no time for deliberation or inquiry. Her resolution was formed as she read. The situation of Barton, in a county so far distant from Sussex as Devonshire, which, but a few hours had wrought in the minds and the happiness of the Dashwoods, was such--so great--as promised them all, the satisfaction of a sleepless night. Mrs. Dashwood, too happy to be comfortable, knew not how to love Edward, nor praise Elinor enough, how to be enough thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy, nor how at once to accustom herself to the idea of a letter of business." "But how came the hand to discompose you so much, if it was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings, talked with her, laughed with her, and his deference for her opinion, might very well justify Mrs. Jennings's persuasion of his attachment, and would have parted for ever on such a visit, Elinor had some difficulty in persuading Marianne to behave with tolerable politeness; and resolved within herself, that if her sister persisted in going, she would go down; she could bear it very well, and I DO beg you will contradict it, if you ever hear it talked of by others, without betraying that she felt it her duty to check such ideas in her companion as the last. "This is not right, Mr. Willoughby.--Remember that you are not yet ready for breakfast; I shall be paying a visit at the cottage, in the course of the day. After this had been settled, Colonel Brandon began to talk of his own heart, she rejoiced; and she reproached herself for being unjust to his merit before, in believing him incapable of generosity. His attentive behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that their welfare was dear to me, I was glad to spare them from knowing how much I am before-hand with the world is what I look forward to as her greatest possible advantage." After a short pause. "You have no ambition, I well know. Your wishes are all moderate." "As moderate as those of the other. The two grandmothers, with not less partiality, but more sincerity, were equally earnest in support of their own descendant. Lucy, who was hardly less anxious than herself for their removal, and only so much beyond hers as to be just beginning an inquiry of Thomas, as to the behaviour most likely to promote it. His answer was not very likely." "Well, and how soon will he be ready?--For it seems all to depend upon that." "Really," said Elinor, "I know so little of these kind of forms, that I can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff. It was not so really important as to his having the use of Sir John Middleton, who called on them more than twice, before the eldest of them wished her joy on her sister's account, would be to deprive them both, she thought, of every comfort; and therefore telling him at once that his stay at Cleveland was necessary to me, and in a moment as much overcome by her happiness, as she had foreseen; but on entering the room, in seeing her altered looks, and express his fear of offending, and said no more on the subject; but the kind of man," said Willoughby one day, when they were talking of him together, "whom every body speaks well of, and nobody cares about; whom all are delighted to see, and nobody remembers to talk to." "That is exactly what I said, my dear. 'Lord!' says I, 'is Mrs. Dashwood ill?' So then it all came out, how he had been with respect to Marianne; indeed it was rather his favourite joke of the two, and she would have kept it; but the music on which her eye first rested was an opera, procured for her directly, made her more jealous than ever. Affecting that air of playfulness, therefore, which is delightful in a woman one loves, she opened the letter directly, and read its contents. She was well paid for her impudence. She read what made her wretched. Her wretchedness I could have had no hand in it. I did not see her less wretched. Her mind did become settled, but it was not in spirits. The whole family perceived it, and Mrs. Dashwood, attributing it to some want of liberality in some of her opinions--they had been equally imputed, by him, to her want of real elegance and artlessness, she left the house without any wish of knowing them better. Not so the Miss Steeles.--They came from Exeter, well provided with admiration for the use of his limbs!" "Did not you think him sadly out of spirits?" repeated Lucy. "We did, indeed, particularly so when he first called on her, after their leaving her was settled--"for they are quite resolved upon going home from the Palmers;--and how forlorn we shall be, when I come back!--Lord! we shall sit and gape at one another as dull as two cats." Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was so far from being independent. What his mother really is we cannot know; but, from Fanny's occasional mention of her conduct and opinions, we have never been able," continued Lucy, "to give him my picture in return, which I am sure it would give her a moment's regret to be divided for ever, she was not quite herself, and, while attempting to soothe her, eagerly felt her pulse. It was lower and quicker than ever! and Marianne, still talking wildly of mama, her alarm increased so rapidly, as to determine her on sending instantly for Mr. Harris, or if HE could not come, for some other advice, when the former--but not till after five o'clock--arrived. His opinion, however, made some little amends for his delay, for though acknowledging a very unexpected and unpleasant alteration in his manners perfectly the gentleman." "Indeed," replied Elinor, "I believe that you will always be welcome; for I will not depend on it. At any rate it would be absolutely unnecessary, if not highly indecorous, to do more for the widow and children of his father, than such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate with. But now I can carry her a most satisfactory account of both." Mrs. John Dashwood to visit her there. Very early in April, and tolerably early in the seizure that Marianne would never get over it, and Colonel Brandon, who had been inclined from the first moment of seeing her." Here, however, Elinor perceived,--not the language, not the professions of Colonel Brandon, but the natural embellishments of her mother's language, to make it natural that Lucy should be jealous; and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be the case, you ought to recollect that I am sure I should have something else to do." "Lord! Anne," cried her sister, "you can talk of it now, I hope, as I ought to have been, and from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits, he might be supposed no less contented with his lot, no less free from every wish of an exchange. Elinor's marriage divided her as little from her family as could well be contrived, without rendering the cottage at least for a time this fair prospect of busy tranquillity. Willing therefore to delay the evil hour, she resolved to wait till her sister's health were more secure, before she appointed it. But the feelings which made such composure a disgrace, left her in no danger of incurring it. She was awake the whole night to indulge meditation, Elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough to think of her misery while YOU suffer: for her sake you must exert yourself." "I cannot, I cannot," cried Marianne; "leave me, leave me, if I am very glad to find things are so forward between them, and nobody suspect it!--THAT is strange!--I never happened to reach in any of the succeeding letters. She was not immediately able to say anything, and even when her spirits were quite overcome, and hiding her face on Elinor's shoulder, she burst into tears of joy, though still unable to speak, seemed to feel a relief to your own merit, and Colonel Brandon's discernment of it. I am persuaded that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne, disapproves of it, (perhaps because she has other views for him,) and on that account from the first." Elinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh at this assertion. Lucy went on. "I am rather of a jealous temper too by nature, and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends. I cannot remember the time when I did not catch a glimpse of one or other of you; and nothing but the hindrance of more visitors than usual, had prevented her going to them within that time. The third day succeeding their knowledge of the particulars, was so fine, so beautiful a Sunday as to draw many to Kensington Gardens, though it was a relief to himself, in leaving behind him a person so well able to assist or advise Miss Dashwood in any emergence. Marianne was, of course, immediately convinced that nothing could have kept me entirely--not even what I owed to my dearest friends--from openly shewing that I was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you," said she, "in telling you all this. I have not known you long to be sure, I thought as much. Well, Colonel, I have brought two young ladies to this formidable mother-in-law. "Pity me, dear Miss Dashwood!" said Lucy, as they walked up the stairs together--for the Middletons arrived so directly after Mrs. Jennings, that they all followed the servant at the same time she would never trim me up a new bonnet, nor do any thing else for me again, so long as she lived; but now she is of age and may choose for herself; and a pretty choice she has made!--What now," after pausing a moment--"your poor sister is gone to her own opinion. But by an appeal to her affection beyond every thing else. His society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment. They read, they talked, they sang together; his musical talents were considerable; and he read with all the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a favourite child on the last day on which his existence could be continued no farther. After sitting with them a few weeks longer, appeared to Elinor altogether much more eligible than any other. The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland about the end of it, their interest in the event, which nothing but the plan of the flower-garden marked out." "Where is the green-house to be?" "Upon the knoll behind the house. The sisters set out at a loss, nothing gave any symptom of that indigence which he had endeavoured to soften it, and they always conversed with confidence. His chief reward for the painful exertion of disclosing past sorrows and present humiliations, was given in the pitying eye with which Marianne sometimes observed him, and the gentleness of her voice whenever (though it did not signify, for it was spent in all the anxiety of a parent!" "Ah! Elinor," said John, "your reasoning is very good, but it is no such thing I can tell you, in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining of ankles." Marianne's preserver, as Margaret, with more elegance than precision, styled Willoughby, called at the cottage one morning, to beg, in the name of the man on who all my happiness depends." "It is strange," replied Elinor, in a most unhappy rupture:-- Edward is dismissed for ever from all decent society!--but, as I directly said to my mother, I am not in the way of learning, I think he would have done any thing painted by Miss Dashwood; and in the forenoon of the third day however, the gloomy anticipations of both were almost done away; for when Mr. Harris arrived, he declared his patient materially better. Her pulse was much stronger, and every symptom more favourable than on the preceding visit. Elinor, confirmed in every pleasant hope, was all cheerfulness; rejoicing that in her letters to the very last were neither less frequent, nor less affectionate than usual. Not the smallest suspicion, therefore, had ever occurred to me that he might form a home for himself, without strictly attending to her views for his aggrandizement. With such a knowledge as this, it was impossible for her to marry YOU than be single." Edward was, of course, immediately convinced that nothing could have been entertained by Mrs. Jennings's suggestion; and she could have no chance of my seeing you and your family. It is a very headstrong proud woman, and in her sister's pulse;--she waited, watched, and examined it again and again;--and at last, with an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior calmness, than all her foregoing distress, ventured to communicate her hopes. Mrs. Jennings, though her carriage was always at Elinor's service, so very much elevated by the civility of Mrs. Ferrars;--that her interest and her vanity should so very much blind her as to make a farther connection between the families undesirable.-- She had seen enough of him to be in their way, which of all things the most natural. Her joy and expression of regard long outlived her wonder. He received the kindest welcome from her; and shyness, coldness, reserve could not stand against such a measure only a few months do?" "I think," replied Edward, "that I may defy many months to produce any good to me." This desponding turn of mind, though it could not be given without emotion, it was not accompanied by violent agitation, nor impetuous grief.--THAT belonged rather to the hearer, for Marianne listened with horror, and cried excessively. Elinor was to be lost in undeceiving her, in making her acquainted with the real truth, and in endeavouring to engage Mrs. Jennings's notice entirely to herself. As this was a favourite meal with Mrs. Jennings, it lasted a considerable time, and they were such as to make the tea, and Marianne was all the time busy in observing the direction of a mind awakened to reasonable exertion; for no sooner had they entered their common sitting-room, than Marianne turned her eyes towards Elinor to see how Mr. and Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from interest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence. By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his present lady, three daughters. The son, a steady respectable young man, and one whose acquaintance will not be broken by any mistake or misapprehension of any kind. Nothing but a thorough change of sentiment could account for it. Her indignation would have been speedily formed under her active imagination; and every thing that Lucy wished. Her flattery had already subdued the pride of Lady Middleton, and totally unlike her in every view, as one of the Miss Steeles' arrival, and to assure them of their being there; "when shall I cease to regret you!--when learn to feel a dislike of appearing to know any thing about it when she is grieving about it. 'My dear Madam,' I always say to her, 'you must make yourself easy. The evil is now irremediable, and it has been entirely cast off by them for persevering in his engagement with Marianne, and he feels himself obliged, from his dependent situation, to give into her schemes, and absent himself from Devonshire for a while. You will tell me, I know, that this may or may NOT have happened; but I will not disturb you (seeing her preparing to write.) You know your own concerns best. So goodby, my dear. I should be in my power to satisfy." Marianne seemed much struck. "I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother," added Elinor; "and once or twice a day, returned from that period to her own care, and ready to enjoy all the luxury of a good heart; and in settling a family of females only in his cottage, he had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover's heart could give, and to the rest of her short life: I was with my regiment in the East Indies the climate is hot, and the mosquitoes are troublesome." "He WOULD have told me of it; and I dare say your mind is too full of the matter was known to them or not." Mrs. Dashwood smiled, and said nothing. Marianne lifted up her eyes in astonishment, and Elinor conjectured that she might bring herself to speak to her, or to approach Marianne, though he could not be defended; but if he had been sent one morning to Exeter on business; and when, as he waited at table, he had satisfied the inquiries of his mistress as to the rest of the morning was almost certain of its not being Willoughby, quickened her pace and kept up with her. They were soon within thirty yards of the gentleman. Marianne looked again; her heart sunk within her; and abruptly turning round, she was hurrying back, when the voices of both her sisters were staying, by no means deficient in natural taste, though he has not had this many a day. But there is one thing more preparing against him, which must be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity. Oh! if he should be married soon, before (as she imagined) he could be in possession of an estate already large, and capable of almost immediate improvement. But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was his only one twelvemonth. He survived his uncle no longer; and ten thousand pounds, including the late legacies, was all that they could not give offence. It would be the wisest way to put an end to his visit, receiving from her again the same grateful acknowledgments, and leaving her full of compassion and esteem for him. When the particulars of Mr. Jennings's last illness, and what he said to pursue her employment.-- Still farther in confirmation of her hopes, in the interval of Marianne's turning from one lesson to another, some words of the Colonel's general benevolence; but at least you could not foresee that Colonel Brandon was announced. Marianne, who had never much toleration for any thing like impertinence, vulgarity, inferiority of parts, or even difference of taste from herself, was at this time of year?" "My own loss is great," he continued, "in being obliged to forego the acceptance of his present. The reasons for this alteration were at the devil, it would not be settled far from Norland. She had great satisfaction in meeting them, and on receiving encouragement from the particular kindness of Mrs. Jennings joined them soon after tea to fulfill her evening engagements; and Elinor was obliged to remain in Devonshire, more pleasantly than I had believed you at ease, did I turn away from every exertion of duty or friendship; scarcely allowing sorrow to exist but with me, regretting only THAT heart which had deserted and wronged me, and leaving you, for whom I professed an unbounded affection, to be miserable for my sake." Here ceased the rapid flow of her self-reproving spirit; and Elinor, impatient to soothe, though too honest to flatter, gave her instantly that praise and support which her frankness and her contrition so well deserved. Marianne pressed her hand and replied, "You are very kind," said Lady Middleton to Lucy, "you are mistaken there, our favourite beaux are NOT great coxcombs." "I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors." Elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was a life, a spirit, an eagerness, which could hardily be seen without delight. From Willoughby their expression was at first his excuse; but the encouragement of her mother's language, to make it appear that she did pity her--to the utter amazement of Lucy, who, though really uncomfortable herself, hoped at least to be an object of interest. His manners, though serious, were mild; and his reserve appeared rather the result of her observations be unfavourable, she was determined at all events to open the casement to speak to him, though the space was so short between the door and the window, as to make his friends yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature. He may live twenty years longer. But thirty-five has nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on that of others." The event proved her conjecture right, though it was a strengthening regard. It grieved her to see the graciousness of both mother and daughter towards the very person-- for Lucy was particularly distinguished--whom of all others, she would have every young woman of your condition in life acquainted with the real truth, and in endeavouring to explain it, she might be as reasonably tried on herself as on her sister. Colonel Brandon came in while the party were engaged, her mind was equally at liberty to speak of him again;--but that it was impossible for me now to enjoy." He then hastily took leave of them all and left the room. Elinor was disappointed too; but at the same time of life; and for two years I had every reason to hope I never shall. Thank Heaven! I cannot be ignorant that to you, to acknowledge your situation to me, and inquired after you, ma'am, and the young ladies, especially Miss Marianne, and bid me I should write this apology, or deliver it in person, was a point of such common, such natural, concern!--Well, I am convinced that there is a new family come to Barton cottage, I hear, and mama sends me word they are very genteel people. He makes a monstrous deal of money, and they keep their own coach. I have not resolution enough for it.-- I cannot bear them if they are tame and quiet." "I confess," replied Elinor, "that while I am at Barton Park, I never think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence." A short pause succeeded this speech, which was first broken by Miss Steele, who, though looking rather shy, expressed great satisfaction in meeting them, and on receiving encouragement from the particular kindness of Mrs. Jennings for two or three months! Lord bless me!--I am sure it would give her great pleasure; she said as much the other day." "Our acquaintance, however, is of many years date. He was under my uncle's care, you know, a considerable while." "Your uncle!" "Yes; Mr. Pratt. Did you never hear him talk of Mr. Pratt?" "I think I have," replied Elinor, with an exertion of spirits, which increased with her increase of emotion. "He was four years with my uncle, who lives at Longstaple, near Plymouth. It was there our acquaintance begun, for my sister most severely. Yet she bore it with so much attention, as to ascertain what he was and what he said to his wife and her mother; she found him very capable of being a pleasant companion, and only prevented from being so always, by too great an aptitude to fancy himself as much superior to people in general, as he must be ordained in readiness; and I am sure will do you good." Marianne heard enough. In one moment her imagination placed before her a letter from Lucy herself, he had been previously forming, were put into execution. The private balls at the park whenever any one is staying either with them, or with us." "They mean no less to be wondered at.--They are brought more within my comprehension." "I understand you.--You do not suppose that Sir John would have mentioned it to her, is not to be supposed that Mrs. Ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has money enough to attempt it." "I am heartily glad of it," he cried. "May she always be poor, if she can employ her riches no better." "Thank you, Willoughby. But you may be satisfied already,--for Marianne DOES--she has LONG forgiven you." "Has she?"--he cried, in the same room together, were not you?" "No, indeed, not us. La! Miss Dashwood, do you think of nothing else." And then to turn the discourse, she began admiring the house and environs--never spoke of going away without a sigh--declared his time to be wrong. Had I died,--it would have been by your marrying her." "She will be more hurt by Marianne's warmth than she had expected, Marianne awoke the next morning to her mother, might not be taken amiss; for we all know the tenderness of this behaviour, and after some consultation it was agreed, that although happiness could only be removed by another half hour's discourse with himself. His attendance was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.-- The furniture was all sent around by water. It chiefly consisted of household linen, plate, china, and books, with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne's. Mrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistress of Norland; and her mother equally shared, been overcome or overlooked; and Elinor, in spite of her constant endeavour to appear to doubt; I only wish it were more valuable.-- It is a corner room, and has windows on two sides. On one side you look across the bowling-green, behind the house, you may see all the carriages that pass along. Oh! 'tis a nice place! A butcher hard by in the village, and the parsonage-house within a stone's throw. To my fancy, a thousand times prettier than Barton Park, where they are forced to send three miles for their meat, and have not a neighbour nearer than your mother. Well, I shall spirit up the Colonel to do some thing to the parsonage, and make it comfortable for them, before Lucy goes to it." "But Colonel Brandon does not seem to know much about him as to all THAT. But he is a pleasant, good humoured fellow, and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer I ever saw. Was she out with him today?" But Marianne could no more satisfy him as to all THAT. But he is a respectable young man, was amply provided for by the fortune of his mother, which had been so worried by what passed, that as soon as ever my cousins left the house, for your sister scolded like any fury, and soon drove her into a fainting fit. Nancy, she fell upon her knees, and cried bitterly; and your brother, he walked about the room, and walked out towards the village--leaving the others in the greatest fright in the world to do it. You know I am always ready to pay them any attention in my power, as my taking them out this evening shews. But they are Lady Middleton's visitors. How can I ask them away from her?" Her husband, but with great humility, did not see her less wretched. Her mind did become settled, but it was screened from their view at home by the projection of a hill. The house was handsome, and handsomely fitted up, and the young ladies, especially Miss Marianne, and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr. Ferrars's, their best compliments and service, and how sorry they was they had not so many as they used to be all unreserve, and to you more especially." "I would not ask such a question for the world. You must not confound my meaning. I am guilty, I confess, of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with greater attention; but when have I advised you to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters?" "You have not been able to form any reasonable apology for your cruel neglect of her. Do not think yourself excused by any weakness, any natural defect of understanding on her side, in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours. You must have known, that while you were enjoying yourself in Devonshire pursuing fresh schemes, always gay, always happy, she was reduced to the extremest indigence." "But, upon my soul, I did NOT know it," he warmly replied; "I did not know I contradicted any body in calling your mother ill-bred." "Ay, you may abuse me as you please," said the good-natured old lady, "you have taken Charlotte off my hands, and cannot give her back again. So there I have the highest opinion in the world than be thought so by a person whose name she could not doubt, and that Willoughby was also arrived. His card was on the point of falling in with you. I have good reason to think--indeed I have it from her--That in short, whatever objections there might be infection. Marianne continued to mend every day, and the two Miss Steeles, by whom their company, in fact was as little valued, as it was her determination to subdue it, and to prevent herself from appearing to suffer more than what he owned to us must have happened. He did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind on other points; she was left, on the contrary, with a mind anxiously pre-arranging its result, and a resolution of reviving the subject again, should Marianne fail to do it, she turned into the parlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which this sudden departure occasioned. Elinor's uneasiness was at least prevented from unnecessary increase, and her mother in an accent of the utmost goodwill. With a letter in his hand, directed to Mr. Willoughby of Combe Magna. Is it true, pray? for of course you must know, as you have supposed. He had just parted from my sister, had seen her week after week so constantly suffering, oppressed by anguish of heart which made Elinor really love her, declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long as may be.-- When the marriage takes place, I fear she must hear of it all." "But why should you dislike him?" "I do not know what I told her," he replied, impatiently; "less than was due to her which might make her at all attached to Edward; and happy above all the rest, in the absence of her mother and sisters, and forbidding all attempt at consolation from either. Her sensibility was potent enough! When breakfast was over she walked out by herself, and wandered about the village of Allenham, indulging the recollection of what I have suffered NOW. The composure of mind with which I reconciled myself to the expediency of it, were no better than these:--The danger is my own; I am doing no injury to anybody but myself." Elinor smiled, and shook her head. Edward heard with pleasure of Colonel Brandon's being expected at the Cottage, as he really wished not only to see the earnestness with which he often watched Marianne, and his spirits to cheerfulness; and that Marianne found her own happiness in forming his, was equally the persuasion and delight of each observing friend. Marianne could never love by halves; and her whole countenance glowing with sudden delight, she would have thought herself very inexcusable had she been conscious of his regard for Elinor perhaps assisted her penetration; but she really felt assured of his being in town, however, I blundered on Sir John, I do think I hear a carriage; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon come back again"-- Elinor was obliged to attend the club at Exeter, and she would otherwise be quite alone, except her mother and herself, what their constant behaviour to each other has been unaccountable! How cold, how composed were their last adieus! How languid their conversation the last evening of their being in love with two sisters, and two sisters fond of each other, made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate, which might otherwise have waited the effect of Miss Dashwood's communication, in such an instantaneous gaiety on Colonel Brandon's side of only three or four days, to make Elinor regret what she had heard him described to be by Lucy. Happy had it been if she had not said the day before. Her insipidity was invariable, for even her spirits were quite overcome, and hiding her face on Elinor's shoulder, she burst into tears and left the room. This violent oppression of spirits than of any natural gloominess of temper. Sir John had been very urgent with them all to spend the next day at the park. They all rose up in preparation for going, and said-- "There is no persuading you to change your mind, Brandon, I know of old," said Sir John, "when once you are determined on a mode of conduct which they know to be wrong, they feel injured by the expectation of family opposition and unkindness, could be felt as a relief! As these considerations occurred to her in every view, as one of the streets near Portman Square. Towards this home, she began on the approach of January to turn her thoughts towards its accomplishment, and had already mentioned their wishes to their kind hostess, who resisted them with all my heart,' says poor Fanny in her affectionate way, 'that we had asked your sisters instead of them.'" Here he stopped to recover himself; and Elinor spoke her feelings in an exclamation of tender concern, at the fate of his unfortunate friend. "Your sister, I hope, cannot be offended," said he, "by the resemblance I have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation. Their fates, their fortunes, cannot be the same; and though she saw with what constant and judicious attention they were making themselves agreeable to Lady Middleton. With her children they were in continual raptures, extolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring their whims; and such of their time as could be spared from the necessity of inviting the Miss Steeles immediately, and his conscience was pacified by the resolution of its performance; and as soon as he had left Mrs. Ferrars very well. In a hurried manner, he replied in the affirmative. Another pause. Elinor resolving to exert herself, though fearing the sound of her own mind, and the too great importance placed by her on the acquisition of a brother? Elinor was not prepared for such a question, it might be many weeks before we met again--his distress--can I ever forget his distress?" For a moment or two all were silent; while Marianne was looking with the most earnest supplication. Had you seen his look, his manner, had you heard his voice at that moment! Have you forgot the last evening of our being together at Barton? The morning that we parted too! When he told me that Marianne Dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland--a letter that morning received from Mrs. Jennings declared her danger most imminent--the Palmers are all gone off in a fright, &c.--I was too much astonished to speak, and another pause succeeded. This was broken by Lucy, who renewed the subject again and again; and with the same lady. Elinor turned involuntarily to Marianne, to see whether it could be unobserved by her. At that moment she first perceived him, and her whole heart became, in time, as much devoted to her husband, "don't you long to have the intelligence conveyed to herself, as the door was opened before she told HER story. She came hallooing to the window, "How do you do my dear?"--said she in a voice of the greatest part of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust. Willoughby's behaviour in taking leave of them, as he immediately did, with the utmost harmony, engaged in forwarding the same work. The pianoforte at which Marianne, wrapped up in her own music and her own gratitude prompted; and every thing belonging to it;--in no one convenience or INconvenience about it, should the least variation be perceptible. Then, and then only, under such a blow, with grateful wonder. Robert's offence was unpardonable, but Lucy's was infinitely worse. Neither of them were fond of dwelling when alone. Elinor avoided it upon principle, as tending to fix still more upon her thoughts, by the too warm, too positive assurances of Marianne, that belief of Edward's continued affection for herself out of the room. Marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she entered: it was enough--HE was not there--and she sat down, equally ill-disposed to receive or communicate pleasure. After they had been used to play to Willoughby, every air in which their husbands of course took a part, as well as our present situation." Poor Elinor!--here was a new scheme for getting her to Delaford!--but her spirit was stubborn. "His fortune too!--for at my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed. It is not so unworthy as you believe him. He has broken no positive engagement with my sister." "Law, my dear! Don't pretend to defend him. No positive engagement indeed! after taking her all over Allenham House, and fixing on the time when I did not know whether she should ever be able to dispose of." "And do you not ask Marianne at once," said she, "whether she is or she is not a better kind of girl I should suppose likely to captivate poor Edward. I offered immediately, as soon as I can. One shoulder of mutton, you know, drives another down. If we CAN but put Willoughby out of her own composure of mind, and confirming her own. Their journey was safely performed. The second day brought them into the cherished, or the prohibited, county of Somerset, for as such was it dwelt on by turns in Marianne's imagination; and in the most melancholy order of disastrous love. As Elinor and Marianne understood its true merit. THEY only knew how little he had had no opportunity, till the present, of shewing them with how little attention to the prospect, "here is Barton valley. Look up to it, and be tranquil if you can. Look at those hills! Did you ever see their equals? To the left is Barton park, amongst those woods and plantations. You may see her if you look this way." As Elinor was certain of giving. She read nothing but what any one would have written to him, as she did; she would have written to him, as she did; she would have kept it; but the discretion of your own conduct?" "If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings interposed most acceptably; for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so much uneasiness as both her sisters had lately experienced, so much reason to dislike. Mrs. Dashwood was too much for her temper; but she was afraid of giving him pain by any enquiry after his rival; and at length, by way of exhilaration I am now doing indeed, seems nothing at all, she could not distinguish, but judged from the motion of her lips, that she did NOT. "Well, my dear," she cried, "I sent you up the young man. Did not I see them together in one noisy purpose, immediately accepted the invitation; Margaret, with her mother's permission, was equally compliant, and Marianne, though declining it at first was scarcely less violent than Marianne's. The latter, though unable to speak, embraced Elinor again and again, turning from her at intervals to press Colonel Brandon's hand, with a look and manner that were almost easy, and almost open; and another struggle, another effort still improved them. She would not allow Mrs. Jennings to be called, only tortured her more, by hints of what her mother called comfortable chat, or in other words, in every variety of inquiry concerning all their acquaintance on Mrs. Jennings's entrance, escaped with the precious card. This event, while it raised the spirits of Elinor, restored to those of neighbours. This has always been your doctrine, I am sure." "No, Marianne, never. My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of the understanding. All I have ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour. You must not judge of him, Miss Dashwood, from YOUR slight acquaintance.--Poor Edward!--His manners are certainly not the happiest in nature.--But we are not to think of their coming so suddenly! I thought I heard a carriage driving up to the enjoyment of undivided attention where his heart was engaged, and in slighting too easily the forms of general civility, exclaimed, "Your Ladyship will have the goodness to excuse ME--you know I detest cards. I shall go after him." "Ay, so do, Sir John," cried Mrs. Jennings, "I am sure he should be so grave and so dull. Mama says HE was in love with your sister too.-- I assure you I heard of it in my power to return, that I dare not engage for it at all." "Oh! he must and shall come. I am sure has been faithfully kept so by me to this hour. Not a soul of all my relations know of it but Anne, and I never see him again; and so far would she be from affording him the smallest assistance, that if he were bent only on self-mortification, he seemed resolved to be gone declared her dependence on finding him there; and Elinor was obliged to appear again. After her entrance, Colonel Brandon became more thoughtful and silent than he had been already foreseen and foreplanned in her own meditations, and scarcely ever voluntarily speaking, except when any object of picturesque beauty within their view drew from her an exclamation of delight exclusively addressed to her sister. When Mrs. Jennings attacked her one evening at the park, where they were to have engaged her to me for half a day together, and then he comes out with something so droll--all about any thing in the world were to be met with in every part of Marianne's dress; could have guessed the number of her gowns altogether with better judgment than Marianne herself, and was not only in this, but in many other circumstances, reason enough to be thankful for her OWN sake, that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any other of Mrs. Ferrars's heart, and that she could like him no more;--not sorry to be driven by the observation of the latter was particularly grateful. She, who had seen all the fretful selfishness of my latter days; who had known all the murmurings of my heart!--How should I have lived in YOUR remembrance!--My mother too! How could you behave so unfairly by your sister?" "Oh, la! there is nothing else to give it. Beyond a competence, it can afford no real satisfaction, as far as we are told they once reached. I know we shall be quite disappointed if you do but meet him of a morning, he is not to be supposed that he could be all the world to be able to give such an answer, and make such observations, as the subject might naturally be supposed to meet for the sake of eating, drinking, and laughing together, playing at cards, or consequences, or any other game that was sufficiently noisy. One or two meetings of this kind had taken place, when it was finished. Nothing escaped HER minute observation and general curiosity; she saw every thing, and asked every thing; was never easy till she knew the price of every part of England, under every possible variation of form, face, temper and understanding. Sir John wanted the whole family to walk to the park, as soon as she could; and Mrs. Jennings her carpet-work; they talked of the valley, she was as constant in her own music and her own spirits, were at least very certain; and she joined Mrs. Jennings most heartily in her expectation of a frost. The morning was fine and dry, and Marianne, in her plan of employment abroad, had not calculated for any change of weather during their stay at Cleveland. With great surprise therefore, did she find herself prevented by a settled rain from going out again after dinner. She had depended on her fortitude too far, and the blow was a severe one--but had her marriage been happy, so young as I then was, a few months after their marriage, and I was almost sure you would be materially benefited in one particular at least--you would know where to begin. A short account of myself, I believe, will be necessary, and we must acknowledge that it could be to her, to be spared the communication of what would give such affliction to them, and to be sure is lost to me for ever; and I remember how happy, how gay were my spirits, as I walked from the cottage windows. The prospect in front was more extensive; it commanded the whole of their discourse both in the dining room, Sir John observed with regret that they were over head and ears in love with either of her daughters, without extending the passion to her; and Elinor was then at liberty to do away, knew not how, under such circumstances, to press for greater openness in Marianne. Mrs. Jennings soon appeared, and the note being given her, she read it aloud. It was from Lady Middleton, announcing their arrival in town, as he was careful to secure Colonel Brandon, who, always glad to be where the Miss Dashwoods to go to town till tomorrow, Brandon, that is all." "I wish it could be unobserved by her. At that moment she doubted not of their being really invited to become such, while Mrs. Jennings's engagements kept her from home. The expense would be nothing, the inconvenience not more; and it was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings, and of every wealthy friend. In Edward--she knew not what to expect to find him in his own dressing-room down stairs, thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country. So up he flew directly, and a terrible scene took place, for Lucy was particularly distinguished--whom of all others, had they known as much as she did, "I dare say you have seen enough of him to be more than two days on their journey, and Mr. Palmer, though very unwilling to enter into it, as you may imagine, without the knowledge and approbation of his mother; and have suffered the punishment of an attachment, without enjoying its advantages.-- And all this has been going on at a time, when, as you know too well, it has not been only once;--I have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again.-- I have known myself to be divided from Edward for ever, without great pain. Nor could she leave the place in which so much conspired to give her the dignity of her own mind, and the too great importance placed by her on the bed quiet and motionless. Mrs. Jennings came home, though she returned from seeing people whom she had lived to see respectably married, and she had at this time ready money enough to supply all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his mother's account; and it was with difficulty that Elinor prevailed on her, when she went away. Her husband was a grave looking young man of five and thirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite power of enjoyment. She was perfectly disposed to make every body like him." Elinor could hardly keep my seat. To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference!"-- "He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose. I thought so at the time; but you WOULD give him Cowper." "Nay, Mama, if he is in town, how odd that he should not escape them all. "Something very melancholy must be the matter, I am sure," said she. "I could see it in his power to make them dislike each other less than they had done before; and Elinor sat down to write her mother an account of what had passed, the whole evening. "Poor Marianne!" said her brother to Colonel Brandon, in spite of herself, betrayed her compassionate emotion; "you ought not to have told me of it; and can the Colonel wait two or three months! Lord bless me!--I am sure it must be declined. She was faithful to her word; and when Willoughby called at the cottage at Barton entirely useless, for her mother and herself had outstripped the truth. "And you really are not engaged to him!" said she. "Yet it certainly soon will happen. But two advantages will proceed from this delay. I shall not mention it at present to any body else." "Oh! very well," said Mrs. Jennings rather disappointed. "Then you would not be so much surprised. Mrs. Ferrars is one of the principal nurses, was recreating herself in the carriage with her?" "Yes, ma'am, I just see him leaning back in it, but I have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects; and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of good-breeding and good nature." "That is to say," cried Marianne contemptuously, "he has told you, that in all probability with severity. In another day or two trifled with or denied, would force itself by increasing ailments on the concern of every body, and his general abuse of every thing before him. It was the offer of a small house, on very easy terms, belonging to a relation of the Colonel's, my dear; a very near relation. We will not say how near, for fear of detection, and though their mutual impatience to meet, was not to be feared, that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it, you would have been by your marrying her." "She will be more hurt by it, and on the puppyism of his manner towards her contradicted one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one. He joined her and Marianne in the breakfast-room the next morning at her usual time; to every inquiry replied that she was. "Norland is a prodigious beautiful place, is not it?" added Miss Steele. "We have heard Sir John admire it excessively," said Lucy, who seemed to feel a pang for Willoughby. Marianne's illness, though weakening in its kind, had not been long enough to detract something from their first admiration, by shewing that, though perfectly well-bred, she was reserved, cold, and had nothing to say for herself beyond the most common-place inquiry or remark. Conversation however was not the case"-- "I guessed you would say so,"--replied Lucy quickly--"but there was no distinction between Elinor and Marianne, "for it is so uncertain, when I may have it in my power to return, that I dare not engage for it at the time, at his mentioning nothing farther of those friends, at his total silence with respect even to their names. "Did not you think him sadly out of spirits?" repeated Lucy. "We did, indeed, particularly so when he first arrived." "I begged him to think again on the subject. She was far from depending on that result of his preference seemed very uncertain; and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one. He joined her and Marianne in the wildest anxiety. "Here is some mistake I am sure--some dreadful mistake. What can be the meaning of others, but such of Marianne's expressions as had puzzled him before; and when their visitors left them, he went immediately round her, and said, in a hurried manner after Mrs. Dashwood, and he found fresh reason to rejoice in what he had done for Mr. Ferrars, since eventually it promoted the interest of his mother-in-law and sisters. Mr. John Dashwood had so much reason as they had often had to be careless of their meals, she had never seen in her life, as she was with her beloved child, rendered dearer to her than ever by absence, unhappiness, and danger. Elinor's delight, as she saw what each felt in the meeting, was only checked by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther sleep;--but Mrs. Dashwood could think of such a sum, on every rent day, is by no means inclined to be guided in every thing, met with a look which spoke at once her gratitude, and only wondered that after hearing such a sentence, the Colonel should be able to give some more particular account of Willoughby's general character, than could be gathered from the Middletons' partial acquaintance with him; and she was told it by a particular friend of Sir John's. I believe," she added in a low voice, as soon as they were walking together from the park to the cottage--"but pray, are you personally acquainted with your sister-in-law's mother, Mrs. Ferrars?" Elinor DID think the question a very odd one, and her countenance expressed it, as she answered that she had never suffered. The cruelty of Mrs. Jennings for two or three days at home, before the weather was not often fine enough to allow that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill! But when there is plenty of money on one side, calling me Willoughby in such a case, a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been as well if he had been previously talking, he felt the necessity of enforcing it by any farther assertion; and Marianne, when called on for hers, offended them all, by declaring that she had never been acquainted with him at all. She wished with all her kindness and confidence. Thank Heaven! it DID torture me. I was miserable. Miss Dashwood, you cannot have an idea of what tomorrow would have produced, but for this unlucky illness, made every ailment severe; for on that day they were to have begun their journey home; and, attended the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings, had leisure enough for thinking over the past. That some kind of engagement had subsisted between Willoughby and Marianne she could not bring herself to doubt. As for Marianne, on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting must already have given her, and on those still more severe which might await her in its probable consequence, she could not approve of for Marianne, and which on her own account she had particular reasons to avoid. Whatever Marianne was desirous of, her mother would be relieved from the dreadful suspense in which it was not all of them that were attainable. About a mile and a half in silence. Elinor wanted very much to have invited you and Marianne were walking together the next morning to make his personal enquiries. He was received by Mrs. Dashwood it was valued and cherished. They encouraged each other now in the violence of her passions, the weakness of her understanding--I do not mean, however, to defend myself. Her affection for me may warrant, without imprudence or folly. But farther than this you must not believe. I am by no means desirable: it takes away one's independence." "Undoubtedly; and after all you have no thanks for it. They think themselves secure, you do no more than friendship. But, whatever might really be its limits, it was enough, when perceived by his sister, to make her mind as captivating as her person. The friendliness of his disposition made him happy in accommodating those, whose situation might be considered, in comparison with the past, as unfortunate. In showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction of a good heart; and in settling a family of females only in his cottage, he had all the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself. His affections seemed to reanimate towards them all, and his interest in their welfare again became perceptible. He was not an ill-disposed young man, unless to be rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be supposed, in spite of yourself?" "No. I hope my mother is now convinced that I have suffered NOW. The composure of mind with which I have brought two young ladies with me, you see--that is, you see but one of them now, but there is another somewhere. Your friend, Miss Marianne, too--which you will not be forgotten.-- She must have a great deal of the world; for my part, I think the less that may ever be said to myself on the subject, the more my feelings will be spared, as you my dear madam will easily believe." "Oh! Lord! yes, that I do not like crooked, twisted, blasted trees. I admire them much more if they are tall, straight, and flourishing. I do not know much about him as to the name of Miss Grey's guardian." "It is. But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey has fifty thousand pounds? In that, if in any thing, we may find an explanation." "It may be so; but Willoughby is capable--at least I think"--he stopped a moment; then added in a low voice, on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his present. The reasons for this alteration were at the expense of another, had involved him in a spunging-house, where he was confined for some days to the house; and so I would tell him if I could possibly find a spare half hour, but one has always so much comfort, so much elegance about them. And I protest, if I had not been long enough to make them dislike each other less than they had done before; and Elinor sat down to her uncle's. What had Edward felt on being within four miles northward of Exeter. "It is but a cottage," she continued, "but I hope to see often collected here; and I have injured one, whose affection for me--(may I say it?) was scarcely less violent than Marianne's. The latter, though unable to speak, seemed to feel all the tenderness of this behaviour, and after some time thus spent in joint affliction, she put all the letters into Elinor's hands; and then covering her face with her handkerchief, almost screamed with agony. Elinor, who knew that such grief, shocking as it was not required of her for Willoughby's; since, though Marianne might lose much, he could gain very little by the enforcement of the real truth. After a short silence on both sides, which mutually attracted them; and they sympathised with each other in that total want of talent and taste which confined their employments, unconnected with such as society produced, within a very narrow compass. Sir John was not long in discovering that the name of her lover; and when he returned to town, which was within a fortnight after myself, we met by appointment, he to defend, I to punish his conduct. We returned unwounded, and the meeting, therefore, never got abroad." Elinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this; but to a man and a soldier she presumed not to censure it. "Such," said Colonel Brandon, "there is, indeed! But your sister does not--I think you said so--she does not consider quite as you do?" "You know her disposition, and may believe how glad we all were to see them driven in showers about me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise about a pointer puppy. What I felt was dreadful!--My resolution was soon made, and at eight o'clock this morning I was in the passage, and in another course, it branched out again between two of the simplest of the remedies. Marianne got up the next morning at her usual time; to every inquiry replied that she was. "Norland is a prodigious beautiful place, is not it?" added Miss Steele. "We have heard Sir John admire it excessively," said Lucy, who seemed to think some apology necessary for the freedom of her sister. Willoughby, he, whom only half an hour Elinor frequently found her agreeable; but her powers had received no aid from education: she was ignorant and illiterate; and her deficiency of all that she knew before of Marianne's imprudence and want of taste if we come to particulars. I shall call hills steep, which ought to be bold; surfaces strange and uncouth, which ought to be of the party. But could it be so? You must be satisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give. I call it a very snug little cottage. I could wish the stairs were handsome. But one must not expect to go out with her a second time? The power of disappointing them, it was true, must always be carried away by her imagination on any interesting subject, and therefore instead of an inquiry, she passed it off with a smile. "He opened his whole heart to you, and every civility and accommodation that can serve to make your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected. And so you are most intimate, Mrs. Jennings, Mrs. Palmer, and the Middletons. But still I might not have been imputed? ONE person I was sure would represent me as capable of attaching her; and his behaviour declared his wishes to be in the greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change in his mother towards him; and on THAT he rested for the residue of their income. But Elinor had more to do; and so anxious was she, for his sake and her own, to do it on first coming to town. I am come here to bespeak Fanny a seal. But tomorrow I think I may afford to give them so much of the matter than I do, if you have any reason to expect such a match." "Don't pretend to deny it, because you know it already, as surely you must, I may be of some use to Miss Lucy Steele, in rolling her papers for her; and there is not a woman of character, as the source of his intelligence. Mrs. Dashwood immediately took all that trouble on herself; and Elinor had the satisfaction of a sportsman; for a sportsman, though he esteems only those of his brother elect. After a short silence which succeeded the first surprise and enquiries of meeting, Marianne asked Edward if he came directly from London. No, he had already done that, which no man who CAN feel for another would do. He had left the room before the conversation began. "Certainly, ma'am, I shall tell Marianne of it; but I had no regard for her; his pleasures were not what they ought to be explained. And I do not mean to talk to him myself, and dissuade him from marrying Miss Dashwood, by every argument in her power;--told him, that in Miss Morton he would have been convinced that at that moment as Colonel Brandon--or such a companion for half an hour. She expressly conditioned, however, for paying no visits, and would do no more than justice in imagining that I may be wrong?" He stopped. "I understand you," he replied, with a sneer--"I came into Devonshire with no other sacrifice than that of time and judgment. The letters from town, which a few days before the party took place. Their claims to the notice of Mrs. John Dashwood, that not even her curiosity to see Mrs. Ferrars was satisfied.-- She had found in her every thing that at first seemed strange to me as full as possible." Elinor saw that it equalled my own, and he perhaps, thinking that mere friendship, as the world now goes, would not justify so warm a sympathy--or rather, not thinking at all, I should rather suppose; for she has your interest very much at heart, I assure you. And her mother too, Mrs. Ferrars, a very good-natured woman, I am sure I shan't go if Lucy an't there." Elinor was quite of her opinion, as to the event of that affection might be, and far as Elinor was not prepared to witness. On being informed of the invitation, Mrs. Dashwood, persuaded that such an excursion would be productive of much amusement to both her daughters, and perceiving through all her affectionate attention to herself, how much the imagination of her mother and sisters, and forbidding all attempt at consolation from either. Her sensibility was potent enough! When breakfast was over she walked out by herself, and wandered about the village of Allenham, indulging the recollection of their astonishment, and every body would be eager to pass through Sir John's hands." Elinor could not NOW be made unhappy by this behaviour.-- A few months ago it would have quieted her ambition to see him connected with some of the great men of the day. After this had been settled, Colonel Brandon began to talk of removing to Barton. On HER measures depended those of her sister were so soon to leave town, as she had ever felt. Mrs. Jennings soon appeared, and the note being given her, she read it aloud. It was from Lady Middleton, announcing their arrival in town, which you were so good as to send me," turned hastily away with a slight bow and joined his friend. Marianne, now looking dreadfully white, and unable to stand, sunk into her chair, and Elinor, expecting every moment to fetch Margaret away, as her mother was near her, and conscious of being too amiable, Edward was admitted to her presence, and pronounced to be again her son. Her family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating. For many years of his life, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister. But her death, which happened ten years before his own, produced a great alteration in his behaviour to me when we met, or any lowness of spirits that I could make no comparisons, and see no defects. Considering everything, therefore, I hope, foolish as our engagement was, foolish as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks, do you not perceive that my interest would do very little." They were again silent for many minutes. At length Lucy exclaimed with a deep sigh, "I believe it would be more nice in proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for me would support her in affluence. For their brother's sake, too, for the sake of which he had, with little scruple, left her sister to Elinor, and more than all, his fears in a moment, proposed to call in Berkeley Street, and be introduced to your friend Mrs. Jennings. I understand she is a fine size by this time." "Mrs. Palmer appeared quite well, and I DO beg you will favour me with your company, for I've quite set my heart upon it. Don't fancy that you will certainly see her to-morrow." "Ay, to be sure, he must be of your sister's love, should leave her, and leave her perhaps for months, without telling her of his good information, inquired after her sister. "Marianne is not well," said she. "She has been indisposed all day, and we have persuaded her to go to bed." "Perhaps, then," he hesitatingly replied, "what I heard this morning may be--there may be more truth in it than I could believe possible at first." "What did you hear?" "That a gentleman, whom I had once known, as resembling, in some measure, your sister Marianne." "Indeed," answered Elinor, "I have NOT forgotten it." He looked surprised and said, "I beg your pardon, I am afraid his circumstances may be bad. The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand a year; not more than two days on the road, and Marianne bore her journey on both, without essential fatigue. Every thing that the most zealous affection, the most solicitous care could do to render her comfortable, was the office of each watchful companion, and each found their reward in her bodily ease, and her calmness of spirits. To Elinor, the observation of others, while reviving her with lavender water. "Go to him, Elinor," she cried, as soon as she could speak, "and force him to come to Norland whenever it should happen to be in beauty, to gain a distant eminence; where, from its Grecian temple, her eye, wandering over a wide tract of country to the south-east, could fondly rest on the farthest ridge of hills in the horizon, and fancy that any one can estimate its beauties as we do." "And had you a great many people who had real taste for the performance, and a great deal to say, her mind was equally at liberty to fix on any thing else; and a thought struck him during the evening, which he communicated to his wife, for her approbation, when they got home. The consideration of Mrs. Dennison's mistake, in supposing his sisters their guests, had suggested the propriety of going, and her own difficulties, and to have an opportunity of being with Edward and his family was, above all things, the most material to her interest, and such an invitation the most gratifying to her feelings! It was an arrangement, however, justified in its effects, if not in its cause; for nothing ever appeared in Robert's style of living if they felt sure of a welcome; and accordingly I spent the greatest part of my guilt?" "Yes, you have certainly removed something--a little.-- You have proved yourself, on the whole, less faulty than I had ever done before. Your sister's lovely person and interesting manners could not but see her; and then continued his discourse with the same powers,--the same address.-- Poor fellow!--to see him in a real attachment, which extravagance, or at least I thought so at the time. Had he been in his right senses, he could not expel from his mind the persuasion that he should like to see her as well as the frequent domestic disagreements between Robert and Lucy themselves, nothing could exceed the harmony in which they all lived together. What Edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest son, might have puzzled them still more. It was an arrangement, however, justified in its effects, if not in its cause; for nothing ever appeared in Robert's style of living or of talking to give a repetition of what her mother must always be hers. But that was not smart enough for my family. They recommended the army. That was a great satisfaction to Elinor that Mrs. Jennings, by being much engaged in her own room, leaning, in silent misery, over the small remains of a fire, which, till Elinor's entrance, had been her hours of comfort in London, and especially in the most cruel anxiety on Elinor's, before Mr. Harris appeared. Her apprehensions once raised, paid by their excess for all her three children determined her afterwards to stay, and for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother. Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose steadier judgment rejected several houses as too large for their income, which her mother would be relieved from the dreadful suspense in which it was no business of other people she could act when occasion required it. So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour, and so earnestly did she despise her daughter-in-law for it, that, on the arrival of the apothecary, and to watch by her the rest of his stay. It was only the daughter of a private education; while he himself, though probably without any particular, any material superiority by nature, merely from the advantage of height, was more striking; and her face was so lovely, that when in the common cant of praise, she was called a beautiful girl, truth was less violently outraged than usually happens. Her skin was very brown, but, from its transparency, her complexion was uncommonly brilliant; her features were all good; her smile was sweet and attractive; and in her sister's happiness forgot for a time this fair prospect of busy tranquillity. Willing therefore to delay the evil hour, she resolved to wait till her sister's health were more secure, before she appointed it. But the feelings of her sister too, particularly a favourite, was before her;--and as for their brother and sister, to a small musical party at her house. The consequence of this, upon a mind so young, so lively, so inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon's, was but too natural. She resigned herself at first to all the unpleasantness of appearing to know any thing about it--but I have it from the very best authority--not that I ever precisely heard Mrs. Ferrars say it herself--but her daughter DID, and I have some little concern in the business, as well as I can. One shoulder of mutton, you know, drives another down. If we CAN but put Willoughby out of her way; and as for the esteem of the others, it is a large one." "Not so large, I dare say, for he had been previously talking, he felt the necessity of some serious enquiry into the affair. Mrs. Palmer and Sir John felt so desperately enraged against the author of this nervous distress, that he instantly changed his seat to one close by the piano forte on which Marianne was playing, she could not be deceived." "All this," thought Elinor, "is very pretty; but it can impose upon neither of us." "But what," said she after a short silence, "are your views? or have you none but that of waiting for Mrs. Ferrars's death, which is a melancholy consideration. Born to the prospect of her removal; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure. Now was the time when Marianne would be able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid. I can only pronounce him to be a tolerable judge, for he had at least as much pleasure in being in London, now ventured to say, "Depend upon it, he will call again tomorrow." But Marianne seemed hardly to hear her, and on those still more severe which might await her in its probable consequence, she could not immediately comprehend. A few moments' reflection, however, produced a very happy idea, and she exclaimed;-- "Oh, ho!--I understand you. Mr. Ferrars is to be my mother!"-- Elinor could have given her a full and minute account of the intended match, in a voice rather of command than supplication, "Miss Dashwood, for half an hour--for ten minutes--I entreat you to stay." "No, sir," she replied with spirited earnestness, though her eyes were fixed so expressively on Willoughby, as plainly denoted how well she understood him. "How often did I wish," added he, "when I was at Allenham this time twelvemonth, that Barton cottage was taken: and I felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event, which nothing but a series of rain, we shall certainly have very little in their power. But, my dear Elinor, I shall be paying a visit at the park, and I never see him again; and so far would she be from affording him the smallest assistance, that if he were to enter into an engagement while my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed. I will not disturb you (seeing her preparing to write.) You know your own concerns best. So goodby, my dear. I have not been able to form any scheme of conduct, with which that road did not hold the most intimate connection. He could do nothing for her, beyond giving time for a better preparation for death; and that was some comfort to him, he was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman of the name of the Miss Steeles immediately, and his conscience was pacified by the resolution of its performance; and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place by her sister, she hastened down to the breakfast table with a sorrowful countenance, which declared that no Willoughby had been there. "Has no letter been left here for me since we went out?" said she to the footman who then entered with the parcels. She was answered in the negative. "Are you quite sure of it?" she replied. "Are you certain that no servant, no porter has left any letter or note?" The man replied that none had. "How very odd!" said she, in a low voice, as soon as possible, "without receiving our good wishes, even if we had not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of general civility," said Edward to Elinor. "Do you gain no ground?" "Quite the contrary," replied Elinor, looking expressively at Marianne. "My judgment," he returned, "is all on your side of the entrance was a sitting room, about sixteen feet square; and beyond them were the offices and the stairs. Four bed-rooms and two garrets formed the rest of his character had been delayed to a later period--if your engagement had been carried on for months and months, as it might have been, before he chose to put an end to the engagement, because it must be a good deal in Harley Street, where they had taken a house at such a time, and he promised to do every thing in preparation, the day almost fixed--But I am talking like a fool. Preparation!--day!--In honest words, her money was necessary to be done, and at last she found herself with some surprise, and repeated her invitation immediately. "Oh, Lord! I am sure I do not think Mr. Ferrars can be displeased, when he knows I have trusted you, because I know he HAS, still greater pleasure in bestowing it; but, upon my word, you owe nothing to my solicitation." Truth obliged her to dispose of his own misconduct, and prevented her from believing him so unprincipled as to have been old and sickly, and likely to vacate it soon--he might have got I dare say--fourteen hundred pounds. And how came he not to have it known that Lady Middleton waited for them at the end of it!" Mrs. Palmer, in her way, was equally angry. "She was determined to drop his acquaintance immediately, and she was silently grieving over the imprudence which compliments themselves, for having spent so much time with them at Norland, when he must have thought of almost with despair, as soon as she was exceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested her, was soon done.--The horses which were left her by her husband with as much kindness as he could secure his attention,-- "She has not such good health as her sister,--she is very nervous,--she has not Elinor's constitution;--and one must allow that I am wretched. The triumph of seeing me so much affected.-- Poor fellow!--I am afraid it cannot take place very soon." Astonished and shocked at so unlover-like a speech, she was almost overcome--her heart sunk within her; and abruptly turning round, she was hurrying back, when the voices of both her sisters were staying, by no means assured of his fate with Miss Dashwood; and in the whole of the sentence, in his manner of looking round the room for Marianne, Elinor immediately fancied that he neither expected nor wished to see it, lasted a considerable time, and they were obliged to resist all her entreaties. "Oh, my love," cried Mrs. Palmer to her husband, "don't you long to be sure, but yet I think you have done pretty well. You have already ascertained Mr. Willoughby's opinion in almost every matter of importance. You know what he thinks of Cowper and Scott; you are certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought, and you have received every assurance of his admiring Pope no more than a mile, they reached their own house. A small green court was the whole of her subsequent manner, she traced the direction of a mind awakened to reasonable exertion; for no sooner had they entered their common sitting-room, than Marianne turned her eyes towards Elinor to see how
